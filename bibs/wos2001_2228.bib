Abstract = {{Six physical and hydrological variables were used to assess
   environmental stability at sites on 10 contrasting streams in the
   Southern Alps of New Zealand. Five of the streams were spring-fed and
   initially designated `'stable'', and the others, which were
   predominantly catchment-fed, were designated `'unstable''. At each site,
   depth, current velocity, and water temperature were measured monthly for
   19 mo, and the distances moved by marked stones in three size groups
   were determined over 18 mo. Stone invertebrate communities were sampled
   at each site at three monthly intervals. Tractive force measurements and
   the Pfankuch stability index were also calculated. Monthly depth and
   current variability, temperature range, Pfankuch stability scores, and
   substrate movement were all greater at the five `'unstable'' sites, but
   the rank order of sites obtained with each measure was not consistent.
   Tractive force was the only stability measure that did not differ
   significantly between `'stable'' and `'unstable'' streams.
   Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to combine values for all
   six variables into single multivariate instability scores (PCA scores
   for Axis 1). These scores were strongly correlated with all individual
   stability variable scores with the exception of those for tractive
   force.
   We suggest that the effects of environmental stability on community
   structure should be assessed using a measure that is representative of
   all the physical characteristics at a study site, and we believe the
   multivariate instability score goes some way towards achieving this.
   Such a procedure, however, does not negate the use of individual
   measures for examining specific environmental relationships as well.
   Although differences in the persistence of some community
   characteristics could be detected using the initial `'stable/unstable''
   groups, others could only be seen when plotted on a more continuous
   scale using the multivariate instability scores. Persistence of the
   dominant invertebrate taxa was high at all sites, but persistence of the
   entire fauna was higher at the stable sites.}},

Abstract = {{Retention of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) is essential to
   the efficient use of organic matter in streams supported by
   allochthonous inputs. To measure retention and to study factors
   affecting retention, we conducted both long-term and short-term
   experiments using small dowels as indices of stick retention and pieces
   of paper as indices of leaf retention. These experiments were done in
   streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. In general, we found that both
   types of CPOM were efficiently retained in all streams. Factors that
   affected CPOM transport and retention were storms, stream size, stream
   depth, and the abundance of retention structures in the streams. After
   initial transport, woody CPOM was transported only during storms.
   Retention was greater in smaller streams and in shallower stream sites.
   Rocks, boulders, and woody debris were the most important retention
   structures. In the stream draining a logged catchment, lower CPOM
   retention was associated with lower abundance of woody debris dams.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic dipterans were sampled from coarse woody debris (CWD) and stony
   benthic habitats from February 1991 through February 1992 in the White
   River, Illinois River, and Clear Creek of the Ozark Plateau in Arkansas.
   Chironomidae was the numerically dominant taxonomic group, and they were
   collected in significantly greater densities from CWD than from benthic
   habitats; but densities of other dipterans did not differ significantly
   between habitat types. Representatives of five taxa were collected in
   significantly greater densities from benthic habitats, and seven from
   CWD. The greatest estimated mean density of dipterans occurred during
   the spring, but differences were not significant because of high
   variation within seasons. The degree of decay of CWD was an important
   microhabitat factor for representatives of six taxa, of which four were
   xylophagous chironomids. The xylophages that were affected by degree of
   decay were Brillia flavifrons, Polypedilum fallax, Stenochironomus sp.,
   and Xylotopus par. Eukiefferiella spp. and Phaenospectra sp. were the
   non-xylophages affected by decay stage. Biofilm volume appeared to be a
   less important factor in CWD use, but was important for representatives
   of two taxa (B. flavifrons and Eukiefferiella spp.).}},

Abstract = {{Particulate organic matter (POM) is a major vector for carbon and
   nutrients in stream ecosystems. The decomposition process by which this
   material enters the food web has been difficult to study directly
   because in-situ degradation rates for POM are difficult to obtain,
   particularly for fine particles. We evaluated a new statistical method
   that estimates POM mass loss rates from indices of microbial enzyme
   activity. Litter bags containing benthic POM in three size ranges-Fine
   (F) 0.063-0.25, Medium (M) 0.25-1 and Coarse (C) 1-4 mm - were placed in
   a eutrophic woodland stream in June 1992. Over a 6-mo period, samples
   were collected and analyzed for mass loss and the activities of seven
   extracellular enzymes involved in the degradation of holocellulose,
   chitin, and polyphenolic compounds. In-situ POM samples were collected
   concurrently and assayed for the same suite of enzyme activities. In all
   cases, mass loss was related to cumulative enzyme activity; however,
   apparent enzymatic degradation efficiencies were generally lower for
   MPOM and FPOM (=MFPOM) than for CPOM by factors of 1.5-7. Separate
   regression models, relating mass loss to average cumulative enzyme
   activity, were developed for CPOM and MFPOM and used to estimate in-situ
   decomposition rates. Mean model-estimated turnover times for in-situ
   CPOM, MPOM, and FPOM were 127, 145, and 185 d, respectively, compared
   with values of 143, 312, and 244 d determined for size-sorted POM
   confined in litter bags. The application of enzymatic decomposition
   models may circumvent some of the methodological problems that have
   limited the study of POM dynamics in lotic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment description is becoming an essential consideration in many
   types of lotic research. This paper examines the necessity for detailed
   organic loss-on-ignition measures and inorganic particle-size-analysis
   in describing streambed sediment samples. Sediment samples (n = 94) were
   obtained from a 150-m stretch of the Madawaska River in central Ontario,
   and a full analysis (organic content and inorganic
   particle-size-analysis) of each sediment sample was carried out, The
   difference between every pair of sample points in the composition of
   sediment was summarized in a distance matrix of average taxonomic
   distances. We quantified the loss of information about variation in
   benthic sediment habitat when (i) organic content of the sediment was
   ignored, (ii) size fractions of sediment were pooled prior to analysis,
   and (iii) the presence or absence of size categories, rather than actual
   mass determinations, were used to describe sediment samples. Distance
   matrices were re-calculated with these cruder sediment descriptions, and
   Mantel's test was used to measure the correlation between distance
   matrices based on varying levels of resolution in sediment analysis.
   Also, a distance matrix was calculated which summarized the difference
   between pairs of sites in the total Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and
   Trichoptera emergence downstream of core removals. This matrix was also
   correlated, using Mantel's test, with distance matrices based on varying
   degrees of resolution in sediment analysis. The original detailed
   sediment description, with organic content present, was highly
   correlated (r = 1.000, p < 0.001) with the detailed sediment description
   excluding organic content. Sediment descriptions with pooled sieves but
   actual mass of fractions were more highly correlated with the original,
   full description of the sediment (r = 0.88 - 0.81, p < 0.001) than
   binary (presence/absence of size fractions) sediment descriptions r =
   0.76 - 0.22, p < 0.001). Variation among sampling points in insect
   emergence was also more highly correlated with sediment data using
   actual mass measures (r = 0.40 - 0.37, p < 0.001) than sediment
   descriptions using only presence/absence data (r = 0.33 - 0.12, p <
   0.001). Both sieve reduction methods suggested in our paper retain most
   of the original sediment-sample information important in explaining the
   variation in emerging insects. The usefulness of pooling sieve
   categories and recording only the presence or absence of size fraction
   categories to future sediment characterizations will depend on the
   extent to which the original sediment information is retained in the new
   characterizations.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of suspended particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolve
   organic carbon, bacteria, and chlorophyll a were measured in a lake
   outlet in western Montana, USA. Seven sites within the first 3 km
   downstream from the lake were sampled over 14 mo. Downstream change in
   concentration of each variable was tested for fit to a power function (C
   = aD(b)). Downstream changes in POC, bacteria, and chlorophyll a,
   sometimes fit a power function, and the value of the exponent b was
   positively correlated with discharge. At low discharge, a downstream
   decline in lake algae was accompanied by an increase in stream algae. At
   high discharge, concentrations of lake algae did not change downstream,
   and some stream algae increased. These patterns suggest that although
   initial concentrations of suspended organic carbon (seston) are
   determined by the lake, within a short distance, concentrations become
   regulated by stream processes. As discharge increases, lake products are
   transported farther downstream. Thus, the extent of the influence of the

   increases and decreases in discharge.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated direct and indirect (food-chain) effects of Bacillus
   thuringiensis var. israelensis (B.t.i.) on selected nontarget benthic
   insects. Sixteen taxa of various Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera,
   and Diptera were exposed to B.t.i. directly, and indirectly through
   ingesting B.t.i.-contaminated food (black flies and conditioned leaves)
   in experiments that were conducted in artificial and natural streams.
   Lethal effects and sublethal effects (drift, feeding, growth, emergence
   success, and time to emergence) were measured up to 35 d following
   B.t.i. exposure. In addition, we measured larval detachment and
   decomposition rates, following B.t.i. application, to determine how long
   B.t.i.-killed larvae remain available to potential consumers. We
   observed no lethal or sublethal effects on most taxa following direct
   and indirect B.t.i. exposure. Mortality was recorded with two species,
   Tipula abdominalis (Diptera:Tipulidae) and Arthroplea bipunctata
   (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae), when immatures were exposed to B.t.i. at
   dosages considerably higher (>50 x and 500 x, respectively) than
   recommended field rates. Acroneuria lycorias (Plecoptera:Perlidae)
   nymphs exposed to a high B.t.i. dose (100 ppm for 120 min) drift at
   higher frequencies than nymphs not exposed. Predators consumed equal
   numbers of B.t.i.-killed and live black flies, except for one trial
   where Isoperla signata (Plecoptera:Perlodidae) ingested significantly
   fewer B.t.i.-killed black flies than live ones, and another trial where
   Ceratopsyche sparna (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae) ingested significantly
   more B.t.i.-killed than live larvae. Shredders switched to consuming
   black fly larvae once the black flies were killed with B.t.i.
   Siphlonurus rapidus (Ephemeroptera:Siphlonuridae) nymphs provisioned
   with B.t.i.-killed larval black flies attained a greater body mass over
   7 d than those not so provisioned. No change in adult emergence success
   or time to emergence was recorded after respective taxa were exposed to
   B.t.i. B.t.i.-killed black fly larvae remained attached to substrates in
   artificial streams up to 16 d, until decomposing beyond recognition. In
   summary, B.t.i. appears harmless to nontarget benthic insects, even when
   these organisms are exposed to higher than recommended dosages, and when
   they consume B.t.i.-killed black fly larvae.}},

   (Orconectes propinquus) on different size classes of zebra mussels in
   aquarium experiments. Crayfish showed a strong preference for small (3-5
   mm) mussels, although larger individuals (8-10 mm, 12-14 mm) were also
   eaten when presented simultaneously. Feeding rates on different mussel
   size classes were affected by crayfish size and sex, although results
   varied between experiments. Survival of zebra mussels was enhanced
   between 3 and 30\% when crayfish were offered alternative macrophyte
   foods (Potamogeton, Vallisneria); however, size selective predation
   patterns on mussels remained virtually unchanged in the presence of
   alternative foods. Time-lapse videographic studies revealed that both
   rejection rate and handling time increased with mussel size. Despite
   high predation rates on `small' mussels, crayfish attacked medium and
   large mussels more often than small individuals. Results of this study
   indicate that predation by O. propinquus on D. polymorpha will be
   limited primarily to small- and medium-sized mussels.}},

   were not exposed to the overlying water. Exposure to sediment comes not
   only through direct contact, but also through filtration of interstitial
   water and sediment-associated fine particulate organic matter. juveniles
   fed on bacteria and bacterial-sized particles as well as algae. Their
   predominant food source appears to vary with age. Pedal-locomotory and
   pedal-sweep feeding behaviors are used to facilitate movement of
   particles into the pedal gape. Pedal-locomotory behaviors were used more
   frequently in the presence of detrital particles while pedal-sweep
   feeding was most frequently observed in a tri-algal suspension.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional techniques for algal enumeration on substrata may ignore
   variation along microenvironmental gradients. To examine
   microdistributional patterns of diatoms on such surfaces,
   topographically simple, nutritionally inert artificial substrata were
   positioned in a duckweed-covered canal and in the littoral zone of a
   prairie lake. After a period of colonization, substrata were sampled
   using a surficial peel technique along a short section suspected to
   traverse sharp microenvironmental gradients of irradiance and nutrient
   concentration. At both sites, significant horizontal and vertical
   microheterogeneity in diatom species abundance was observed on a single
   substratum. A zonation of diatom species occurred with depth in the
   duckweed mat; Achnanthes hungarica, an apparently host-specific taxon,
   was distributed mostly in the leaf zone of the mat. Join-count analysis
   of a peel sample from the lake demonstrated that the major diatom taxa
   were significantly more abundant on some parts of the substratum than
   others. Refined nearest-neighbor analysis of mapped populations of
   Cocconeis diminuta and Epithemia turgida in these peels showed that they
   were significantly aggregated in the distance range of a few cell
   lengths, suggesting that their progeny were only weakly motile after
   cell division. A relatively motile diatom, Achnanthes hungarica, was
   distributed randomly at low cell density; a more dense A. hungarica
   population was distributed regularly. These results illustrate the
   importance of examining microdistributional patterns of diatoms on
   substrata as the genesis of ultimate community development and
   macrodistribution.}},

Abstract = {{A manipulative experiment was conducted to evaluate a biochemical method
   for using periphyton in water quality assessment. Periphyton assemblages
   that developed in situ on ceramic tiles placed in a reference site in

   each site were analyzed for chlorophyll a content, rate of
   photosynthesis (by `'C uptake), and fatty acid composition, 3, 17, and
   35 days after being transferred to the sites. Chlorophyll a and
   photosynthetic rates per unit of chlorophyll at polluted sites were
   generally lower than at corresponding reference sites. More than 50
   different fatty acids were separated and identified in the periphyton
   phospholipids; 12 of the 50 accounted for more than 90\% of the total
   fatty acids. Periphyton fatty-acid biomarkers revealed differences in
   the periphyton taxonomic composition between reference and polluted
   sites. Fatty acid profiles indicated a shift from diatom to green
   alga-dominated assemblages in reference and chlorine contaminated sites
   respectively. Individual fatty-acid biomarkers specific for green algae
   (18:3omega3 or alpha-linolenic acid) and diatoms (20:5omega3 or

   swimming legs biarticulate, but the male has most rami biarticulate and
   the leg 4 exopodite triarticulate. Only two other species of Diacyclops
   show comparable extreme reduction of the swimming legs. These are
   Diacyclops virginianus and Diacyclops trajani (a new name proposed for
   Speocyclops minutissimus sensu Petkovski 1954).
   The swimming leg articulation patterns of all species of Diacyclops are
   reviewed. This is the first report of consistent sexual dimorphism in
   swimming leg articulation in Diacyclops. Sexual dimorphism in the
   swimming legs rarely occurs in the subfamily Cyclopinae. We suggest that
   preferential reduction in endopodites of posterior legs of smaller
   cyclopines allows the female genital double somite to remain relatively
   large.
   Many interstitial cyclopine copepods possess distinctive morphological
   features. They are small, have a relatively large genital double somite,
   and produce relatively large eggs. Typically, their body appendages
   (antennule, antenna, mouthparts, and swimming legs) are short with

Abstract = {{This overview of non-visual communication in freshwater benthic animals
   emphasizes recent studies of the effect of chemical and mechanical
   signals on predator-prey interactions of benthic macroinvertebrates and
   amphibians. Prey species use chemical signals to, modify their
   morphological development, life history strategy, feeding, and predator
   avoidance behavior. The advantages of chemical signals are that they can
   be used in dark or turbid environments by animals that do not have
   image-forming eyes. Chemical signals are more persistent than mechanical
   signals, and they allow species-level identification of predator
   species. In streams, prey species may use mechanical signals
   (hydrodynamic pressure waves or sound) to avoid predators approaching
   from downstream (a situation characteristic of streams and in which
   chemical signals are unreliable) and to initiate escape responses.
   Predators often depend on chemical signals to stimulate or inhibit
   feeding, and they use species-specific mechanical signals to locate or
   track prey or potential mates. The exact nature of non-visual signals
   depends on ecological constraints of both the sender and receiver.
   Responses to non-visual signals may be adapted to local predator
   conditions. Non-visual signals are effectively used over a wide range of
   temporal and spatial scales in all aquatic habitats. Organisms often
   adjust their responses as ontogenic development results in changing
   size, diet, and habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies on single species of snails reached conflicting
   conclusions regarding the importance of chemical cues in
   predator-avoidance behavior. We performed laboratory experiments to
   determine if chemically mediated, predator-avoidance behavior, such as
   crawling out of the water by freshwater gastropods, occurred among prey
   of different species from several geographic sources: Oklahoma, Oregon,
   and Wisconsin. We compared responses of eight gastropod populations when
   they were exposed to predation by three species of crayfish. We observed
   no crawl-out from two prosobranch species. Individuals from four of six
   populations of pulmonates responded to crayfish predators; physid and
   lymnaeid populations consistently responded whereas some planorbid
   populations did not respond.
   We also examined individual variation in response to predators and the
   proximate costs and benefits to prey associated with crawling out of the
   water. Trade-offs between risks of immediate, direct mortality from
   aquatic, amphibious, or terrestrial predation relative to delayed,
   indirect mortality associated with desiccation, are influenced by shell
   size, thickness, and morphology, as well as physiological adaptations
   among various pulmonate populations. If water depth is sufficient to
   provide spatial refuge from crayfish, smaller snails can reduce their
   losses to predation by moving to the surface of the water or by crawling
   out. In previous studies, Physella virgata and Planorbella trivolvis
   frequently used predator-avoidance behavior when young, but as shell
   size and strength increased with age, the larger individuals spent less
   time crawling out of the water. In this study none of the planorbids
   (Helisoma anceps or Gyraulus parvus) crawled out, even when young. These
   differences are apparently due to differences in selection pressures
   caused by differences in use of various microhabitats where risk of
   predation varies over time.}},

Abstract = {{Montane, tropical streams in Puerto Rico are dominated by decapod
   crustaceans. The most ubiquitous freshwater shrimp, with a distribution
   ranging from mangrove swamps to the highest-elevation pools, is Atya
   lanipes, a scraper/filterer. A large predatory shrimp, Macrobrachium
   carcinus, is much less abundant but dominates the top of the stream
   foodweb. As part of our longterm ecological research, we have observed a
   general negative relationship between Atya abundance and the presence of
   the large predatory shrimp. In a series of laboratory and field
   experiments, we showed that this relationship was primarily due to
   avoidance responses by Atya to the predator species. Furthermore, our
   experiments showed that both chemical and mechanical/tactile cues of
   predator presence determined the among-pool distribution of Atya within
   streams. Although chemical cues alone elicited a relatively weak
   response, the combination of chemical and tactile cues resulted in very
   strong movement responses. If the prey were confined to pools with
   predatory shrimp, the prey significantly decreased their overall
   movement and spent substantially more time in crevices. If given the
   opportunity, prey shrimp emigrated out of areas that had predatory
   decapods.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic and water-borne chemical stimuli are considered important
   cues that initiate anti-predator behaviours of mayfly larvae. We tested
   the hypotheses that chemical stimuli from conspecifics and the
   predacious fish Rhinichthys cataractae and hydrodynamic stimuli from a
   Rhinichthys model would initiate anti-predator responses by mayfly
   larvae of Ephemerella aurivillii, Paraleptophlebia heteronea, and Baetis
   tricaudatus. A second set of experiments tested the hypotheses that
   chemical stimuli from conspecifics and the predacious stonefly
   Claassenia sabulosa and hydrodynamic stimuli from a Claassenia model
   would initiate responses by Baetis. These hypotheses were tested in
   laboratory streams where mayfly larvae received either chemical stimuli,
   hydrodynamic stimuli, or the combination of hydrodynamic and chemical
   stimuli. Responses by larvae to these stimulus types, in terms of use of
   substratum surfaces and drift rates, were compared with those by larvae
   in control streams without conspecific and predator stimulus types.
   Responses to chemical stimuli were variable depending upon mayfly
   species and the chemical stimulus type. For instance, while Ephemerella
   and Paraleptophlebia responded to Rhinichthys odours, Baetis did not
   respond to either Rhinichthys or Claassenia odours. Paraleptophlebia
   responded to conspecific odours whereas Ephemerella and Baetis did not.
   In contrast, all three mayfly species responded to hydrodynamic stimuli
   either alone or when combined with chemical stimuli. Responses by Baetis
   were more complex when chemical stimuli were combined with hydrodynamic
   stimuli. For instance, although Baetis did not respond to conspecific
   odours alone, drift was significantly higher in streams receiving the
   three stimuli of conspecific odours, predator odours from Rhinichthys,
   and hydrodynamic stimuli from a Rhinichthys model when compared with
   streams that received only the conspecific odours combined with the fish
   model. Similarly, an enhanced response was observed when Baetis odours
   were combined with Claassenia odours and the Claassenia model. Thus, the
   lack of a response to a chemical stimulus did not preclude an enhanced
   response when combined with other stimulus types. These observations
   suggest that although some mayflies are capable of detecting the
   presence of some chemical stimuli, a response is not elicited unless the
   stimulus is accompanied by additional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Tadpoles of the tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) are common in riffles
   within many small, high-gradient streams of the Pacific Northwest
   (United States and southern Canada), where they typically graze
   periphyton from exposed cobbles. We conducted field observations and
   experiments in Clearwater Creek, southwestern Washington, to determine
   if tadpoles would reduce their feeding activity (i.e., emergence from
   crevices to graze periphyton) in the presence of non-visual cues
   released from each of four aquatic predators: giant salamanders
   (Dicamptodon spp.), cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki), brook trout
   (Salvelinus fontinalis), and shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus). In
   absence of predators, tadpoles usually emerged from under cobbles to
   feed at night (2000-0100 h), and spent the remainder of the 24-h
   interval hidden in crevices. In the presence of giant salamanders,
   cutthroat trout, and brook trout that were all confined within separate,
   in situ enclosures immediately upstream of tadpoles, tadpole activity
   was reduced two- , three- , and six-fold, respectively, compared with
   predator-free controls. In contrast, tadpoles appeared unable to detect
   upstream sculpins. Subsequent consumption experiments in the laboratory
   showed that salamanders, sculpins, and cutthroat trout all were capable
   of consuming tadpoles in both structurally simple and complex habitats.
   We hypothesize that the inability of tadpoles to detect predaceous
   sculpins may explain why tailed frog tadpoles are largely absent from
   lower-gradient streams where sculpins are often abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of aquatic animals rely on chemical cues to assess the risk
   of predation. Although amphibians are known to have adaptations to avoid
   predatory fish, little is known about their adaptations that allow them
   to co-occur with other aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate predators.
   Adult California newts (Taricha torosa) prey on egg masses and larvae of
   conspecifics. Larvae use chemical cues to assess the risk of
   cannibalism. Laboratory studies showed that larvae that are two weeks
   post-hatching hid in response to chemical cues from adults. Larvae five
   weeks post-hatching did not respond to conspecific cues regardless of
   previous exposure to adult cues. Field surveys supported the prediction
   that small larvae would use refuges more than larvae that are only
   slightly older. Surveys of natural stream pools showed that newt larvae
   spent more time in refuge early in the summer than they did later in the
   summer. This behavioral shift also corresponds to the time of year when
   adults leave the streams and return to land. Thus, newt larvae showed an
   abrupt ontogenetic change in their response to conspecific chemical
   cues. Reduced sensitivity to conspecific risk suggests that large newt
   larvae are less vulnerable to conspecific adults than small larvae.}},

Abstract = {{Many mayfly species have synchronous univoltine life histories over
   broad geographic ranges, but the life-history adaptations underlying
   their seasonality remain unidentified. We investigated whether simple
   adaptations in the response of development rate to temperature might
   account for the observed phenology of adult emergence and the 1- and
   2-year life histories of eight mayfly species studied in Piedmont
   streams of eastern North America between 34-degrees-N and 50-degrees-N
   latitude. We present a model consisting of two sequential life-history
   stages. Development rate in each stage is a linear function of
   streamwater temperature above a lower threshold but, in the first stage,
   a developmental quiescence occurs whenever a maximal temperature is
   exceeded. The five model parameters are assumed not to vary with
   latitude. Using daily field temperatures, the model simulated several
   successive generations beginning from an arbitrary day of the year. With
   parameters fitted from the field data, the model could reproduce both
   the univoltine life history and the latitudinal variation in the timing
   of adult emergence for six species. For two additional species, the
   model reproduced a northward transition to a semivoltine life history.
   The simulations suggest that nearly all development occurs in spring and
   autumn during periods of roughly equivalent thermal regime at all
   latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the phenology and life-cycle of a population of the perlid
   stonefly, Agnetina capitata (Pictet), in Cascadilla Creek, Tompkins
   County, New York, including the pattern of larval growth throughout the
   year, the period of adult emergence, and the development of eggs under
   laboratory conditions. Eggs did not develop at 5-degrees-C and hatching
   was negligible at 10-degrees-C, suggesting that the lower threshold for
   embryonic development in A. capitata is above those temperatures. Median
   egg development time significantly decreased with increasing temperature
   from 15 to 20-25-degrees-C. Independent of temperature, however, there
   was considerable variation in the development time within egg clutches.
   Thus, the delay in hatching of A. capitata eggs is complex, showing
   characteristics of both quiescence and diapause-mediated dormancy.
   Changes in larval size were not observed during the winter, suggesting
   that stream temperatures are too low for growth and development. Last
   instars first appeared in May, and pharate adults were collected in
   emergence traps throughout June and July. The distribution of emergence
   was characterized by two peaks in both males and females. Slight
   protandry was observed in both emergence peaks, and a decrease in size
   throughout, the emergence season occurred for both sexes. Growth
   patterns of A. capitata larvae were consistent with a complex life cycle
   that is completed in at least two years and characterized by multiple
   developmental pathways (cohort splitting). Delayed hatching within
   egg-clusters, an extended emergence period for adults, and an
   oviposition period spread out over the life span of the female lead to
   an extended larval recruitment period and large variation in larval size
   in the population. Those larvae that hatch early, soon after the
   beginning of oviposition during the summer, seem to complete the life
   cycle in two years; but they emerge later in the season than those that
   hatched from eggs in the fall or early spring, and emerge after three
   years from oviposition.}},

Abstract = {{This research examined effects of heavy metals on benthic
   macroinvertebrate communities in the upper Arkansas River, Colorado.
   Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected seasonally ( (fall, spring,
   and summer) over a 2-yr period upstream and downstream from two sources
   of metals, Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel and California Gulch.
   Community responses to metals observed in this study were similar to
   those reported previously for other streams. Benthic communities at
   reference stations were dominated by mayflies (Ephemeroptera), which
   generally constituted > 50\% of the total individuals collected. In
   contrast, highly polluted and moderately polluted sites were dominated
   by Orthocladiinae chironomids and caddisflies (Trichoptera),
   respectively. The spatial distribution of specific taxa at the Arkansas
   River was influenced by several factors, including their tolerance for
   heavy metals, their recolonization ability, and natural environmental
   conditions. Distribution patterns of some groups (e.g., mayflies,
   stoneflies, beetles, and Orthocladiinae chironomids) appeared to be
   directly affected by heavy metals, whereas the distribution of other
   groups (e.g., caddisflies and black flies) was probably more influenced
   by factors such as food availability. Macroinvertebrate community
   responses to metals were complicated by natural seasonal and
   longitudinal changes in community composition. The greatest effects on
   community composition and abundance of sensitive taxa were observed
   during spring, when metal levels were highest. Some longitudinal changes
   in species richness and abundance of dominant taxa were independent of
   heavy metals. Determination of the effects of heavy metals on benthic
   communities requires careful evaluation of natural changes in community
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies on cool, forested streams have shown that removal of
   riparian canopy leads to higher incident radiation, blooms in algal and
   macroinvertebrate populations, and concomitant increases in salmonid
   abundance. In warm, high-elevation desert streams, however, an open
   canopy may not increase salmonid density. Our seven study reaches on
   3rd-order tributaries of the John Day River in eastern Oregon included
   riparian areas ranging from denuded, heavily grazed streambanks to
   intact conifer forest. Average summer solar inputs to these sites varied
   from 165 to 2230 megajoules/m2, and stream temperatures were influenced
   by the density and extent of canopy. Densities of steelhead trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and sculpin (Cottus spp.) decreased significantly
   with greater incident radiation and higher stream temperatures, although
   many warmwater cyprinids increased in abundance in unshaded sites.
   Periphyton standing crops (g ash-free dry mass/m2) closely tracked solar
   inputs and was, in turn, strongly positively correlated with biomasses
   of total invertebrates and of grazers. Collector, shredder, and predator
   biomasses, and numerical abundances of all invertebrate groups, did not
   change with canopy density. The abundances of chironomids and baetids
   were unrelated to increases in light or algal resources, in contrast to
   studies in Cascades and Coast Range streams where irruptions of these
   taxa occurred in canopy openings. In our streams the large-bodied
   caddisfly Dicosmoecus accounted for the higher total invertebrate
   biomass observed in exposed sites. These insects composed 55-96\% of the
   total biomass in open reaches but only 0-1.4\% in the three most shaded
   sites. Increases in total invertebrate biomass with increasing light
   levels or periphyton were not observed when Dicosmoecus were removed
   from the analysis. Dicosmoecus are consumed infrequently by juvenile
   trout or other small fish species common in John Day tributaries;
   consequently, extensive openings in the canopy appear to produce few
   advantages to upper trophic levels in these streams.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was designed to test the importance of the potential
   interaction (inhibition or enhancement) between slow and fast decaying
   leaf species on processing rates in a stream and its floodplain. The
   decomposition of water oak (Quercus nigra) and sweetgum (Liquidambar
   styraciflua) in single-species packs was compared with water oak plus
   sweetgum in mixed-species packs within three habitats (stream snags,
   floodplain pools, and elevated floodplain surfaces) at three sites in
   coastal plain streams. Fast-decaying sweetgum leaves did not enhance the
   rate of oak decomposition. Sweetgum leaves in mixed packs decomposed
   more slowly than single species packs in seven out of nine comparisons.
   Increases in bacterial density on leaves were depressed in mixed-species
   packs relative to single-species sweetgum packs. Fungal hyphae could not
   be observed in mixed or single-species packs. The effect of oak leaves
   on sweetgum leaves was affected by frequency and period of inundation.
   Macroinvertebrate shredders were rare or absent from most leaf packs
   collected from stream snags and floodplain pools. Over 40\% of leaf
   packs placed in the stream contained no shredders, while another 28\%
   contained <0.001 g shredders/g leaf dry weight. Therefore, shredders
   were to rare to influence overall leaf processing rates. These studies
   suggest that microbial processing accounts for most leaf decomposition
   and oak leaf leachate is shown to be inhibitory to microbial processing
   of sweetgum leaves.}},

Abstract = {{The leaf pack method has been used extensively as the standard protocol
   for tracking the in-stream processing of leaf detritus. However, a major
   deficiency of the method has been that it does not directly measure the
   processed condition of natural, multispecies accumulations of leaves.
   The method reported here allows mass loss of leaf detritus to be related
   to leaf toughness. Studies of dry-mass loss and leaf toughness of black
   cherry (Prunus serotina) leaves were conducted in summer 1992 in
   Linesville Creek and Powdermill Run (Pennsylvania, USA), and during
   fall/winter 1992-1993 in Powdermill Run. Leaf toughness was measured
   with a digital force-gauge penetrometer. Penetrometer measurements
   determined the peak force (nearest 0.001 Newton) necessary to drive a
   steel rod through the leaf tissue. In all studies, dry mass loss was
   best explained by a linear regression model and leaf toughness loss by a
   negative exponential regression model. The natural logarithm of mean
   toughness per leaf pack predicted percent mass remaining per leaf pack
   exceptionally well in both streams (r2 = 0.90-0.95). These results
   suggest that leaf toughness can be used to determine in-stream
   processing rates of natural leaf detritus if dry mass-toughness
   relationships are established.}},

Abstract = {{Transport patterns of bacteria in streams depend largely on processes of

   with various microorganisms, including bacteria, embedded in a matrix of
   extracellular material. These complex communities, called biofilms, may
   be disrupted by movement and feeding activities of macroinvertebrates
   causing bacterial cells to detach. Laboratory experiments were conducted
   to assess the role of stream macroinvertebrates in detachment of
   bacteria from biofilms. Marked bacteria that had a rare combination of
   antibiotic resistances were used in microcosms as tracers of bacterial
   exchanges. The role of macroinvertebrates in movement of bacteria from
   leaves to water was investigated by including either mayfly, stonefly,
   or dragonfly nymphs or glass shrimp in microcosms. The presence of
   macroinvertebrates did not alter bacterial exchange between habitats.
   There were considerable variation among replicates for some
   macroinvertebrate treatments, indicating invertebrates may cause large,
   catastrophic releases of bacteria from biofilms on leaves or fecal
   pellets. Alternatively, invertebrates may not be directly involved in
   these releases if pulses of bacteria result from disintegration of fecal
   pellets. The effect of invertebrate density on exchange was measured by
   varying mayfly nymph density. No significant differences among densities
   were detected. The ability of macroinvertebrates to serve as vectors for
   transfer of bacteria between leaf packs was also investigated. Although
   transfer by invertebrates was detected in some experiments, transfer was

   and C-14-bicarbonate could differentiate grazing by Physella virgata, a
   pulmonate gastropod, on the bacterial and algal components in
   periphyton. Large amounts of H-3-AA became associated with periphyton as
   a result of adsorption to periphyton, rather than microbial uptake. As a
   consequence of this abiotic adsorption of H-3-AA by periphyton, uptake
   of H-3 by grazers could be due to ingestion of either H-3-labeled
   bacteria or detritivory on material to which H-3-AA were adsorbed.
   Physella was able to ingest and assimilate adsorbed H-3-AA directly in
   the absence of any bacterial uptake of amino acids. In contrast to
   H-3-AA, relatively little C-14-bicarbonate adsorbed to periphyton, and
   essentially all of the uptake could be attributed to photosynthetic

   used to generate four algal patch types, which differed in the abundance
   of several diatom species and the green alga Stigeoclonium. Patch
   preference of larvae was negatively correlated with abundance of
   Stigeoclonium, chlorophyll a concentration, and algal biovolume.
   Preference was positively correlated only with algal diversity. At a
   density of 0.66 individual/cm2 on preferred patches, larvae did not
   significantly reduce the chlorophyll a content of patches. Chironomid
   grazing had no effect on taxon diversity of periphyton assemblages. Data

   distributions within Montezuma Well, Arizona, indicate nearly complete
   separation of habitat ranges between two congeneric populations.
   Hyalella montezuma inhabits the pelagic zone and a Potamogeton-dominated
   portion of the littoral zone, while H. azteca is restricted to a narrow
   band of shoreline Berula and Eleocharis roots. A population of H. azteca
   from nearby Stoneman Lake was included in the study for comparison with
   populations in Montezuma Well. We estimated genetic distance measures by
   random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) using the polymerase
   chain reaction with ten-base primers of arbitrary sequences. Based on 96
   amplified fragments, the genetic distance between H. montezuma from
   Montezuma Well and H. azteca from Stoneman Lake was 0.19, whereas the
   distance between H. montezuma and H. azteca from Montezuma Well was
   0.77. Observations of swimming behavior were consistent with genetic
   data: H. montezuma and H. azteca from Stoneman Lake spent significantly
   more time swimming than did H. azteca from Montezuma Well. These results
   suggest speciation resulted from genetic differentiation before
   introduction of ancestral populations to Montezuma Well.}},

Abstract = {{Increased use of artificial streams in aquatic research over the last 20
   years has not been accompanied by a systematic, critical analysis of
   their advantages and disadvantages. A symposium held at the 1992 annual
   meeting of the North American Benthological Society in Louisville,
   Kentucky, attempted specifically to provide this information. We define
   an artificial stream as any constructed channel that has a controlled
   flow of water and that is used to study a physical, chemical, or
   biological property of natural streams. The following aspects of
   artificial streams were covered in the symposium: historical
   perspectives, hydrodynamics, algal-nutrient dynamics, macroinvertebrate
   growth, grazer-algal interactions, fish ecology, disturbance,
   ecotoxicology, small- and large-scale artificial streams, and
   longitudinal linkages. Although the symposium addressed a wide variety
   of subjects, each contribution was linked by a common desire to
   ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of artificial streams relative to
   that subject. Major conclusions that emerged from the symposium include;
   (1) there is no single best design for artificial streams; appropriate
   stream design is contingent on the question being asked; (2) research
   geared to mechanistic understanding of lotic processes is particularly
   well-suited for artificial streams; and (3) generation of testable
   hypotheses, which can then be validated in natural stream ecosystems, is
   a useful application of research in artificial streams.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the microdistribution of benthic macroinvertebrates were
   observed, between patches identified as refugia from high flow and the
   remaining benthic habitat, over a range of discharges in a small stream
   with prominent flow refugia. Total invertebrate abundances were similar
   across all patch types at baseflow, but local densities were higher in
   flow refugia after periods of high and fluctuating flow. Different
   species- and size-specific responses were observed: microdistributions
   of larval Chironomidae and small nymphs of the stonefly Leuctra nigra
   did not change with discharge. Conversely, the stonefly Nemurella
   pictetii and large nymphs of L. nigra were most abundant in refugia,
   relative to the remaining benthic habitat, during periods of high and
   fluctuating discharge. The interactive effects of leaf litter and local
   flow conditions on species microdistributions were investigated. In some
   seasons, some species may respond indirectly to hydraulic conditions
   through their direct response to litter mass. Observed microdistribution
   changes probably do not reflect very short-term reactions to individual
   flow events, but perhaps a longer-term response to seasonal flow
   conditions. These are some of the first field data implicating the role
   of in-stream flow refugia in macroinvertebrate community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial respiration on sticks and leaves, measured as rate of oxygen
   uptake, was compared among four sites (2nd-4th order) along Ball
   Creek/Coweeta Creek, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina.
   Senescent rhododendron and birch leaves were placed in the stream at
   each site on 21 October 1990. Microbial oxygen uptake rates were
   measured for both leaf species beginning 15 December 1990 and continuing
   monthly until leaves were no longer intact (birch-2 mo, rhododendron-7
   mo). Oxygen uptake rates also were measured monthly for 1 yr on sticks
   (1-3 cm diameter) collected from the stream at each site. Oxygen uptake
   rates (mg O2/hr) were calculated on the basis of surface area and
   ash-free dry mass (AFDM). Mean respiration rates per unit surface area
   of substrate were highest for sticks, followed by rhododendron, then
   birch, indicating that substrate stability and persistence may affect
   microbial respiration in streams. When expressed on an AFDM basis,
   respiration rate was highest for birch, followed by rhododendron, then
   sticks. Respiration rates were significantly correlated with temperature
   for both rhododendron leaves and sticks on both an AFDM and surface area
   basis. Respiration rates on rhododendron also increased with exposure
   time. Rhododendron leaves represent a long-lasting leaf source for
   microbial activity in streams. Differences in respiration rates among
   sites, for both rhododendron leaves and sticks, can be explained
   primarily by differences in water temperature. The high respiration rate
   per unit surface area on sticks suggested that small woody debris can
   play a significant role as a substrate for microbial metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic detritus was collected from an unnamed stream in Holly Springs
   Experimental Forest, Mississippi, and from King's Creek, Kansas.
   Detritus was wet-sieved into five size classes from 1 mm down to 0.075
   mm. Water and particles passing through the 0.075-mm sieve were
   vacuum-filtered through 0.45-mum membrane filters (Millipore); particles
   retained on these filters represent the sixth size class. Scanning
   electron microscopy revealed fine particulate organic matter (FPOM),
   fine particulate inorganic matter (FPIM), and fine particulate matter
   (FPM), i.e., aggregates of organic and inorganic particles. Many of
   these particles fell within the expected size ranges; however, we also
   detected numerous particles too small to have been retained by the
   sieves. Laboratory techniques were developed to separate the FPOM from
   the FPIM. Using nitrogen-adsorption techniques, surface-area
   measurements were made on the separated fractions as well as on samples
   that had been only wet-sieved. Comparisons of mean mass-specific surface
   areas (m2/g) revealed significantly lower values when inorganic material
   was left in the sample (FPM) or when the sample contained only inorganic
   material (FPIM). King's Creek samples had much greater mean surface area
   per unit mass than did Holly Springs samples. When location and particle
   size class were considered together, location explained most (85\%) of
   the variation in surface area. When season and size class were analyzed
   together, most of the variation (61\%) was explained by size class.
   Organic content, size class, season of collection, and collection site
   are all important influences on FPM surface area and should be
   considered in studies of surface-related phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Periphyton is so highly variable that the community resists modelling.
   To explore the unpredictability of this important resource, we studied:
   1) alternative variables to the traditional trophic ones, 2) the spatial
   scale of periphyton variability, and 3) different levels of description
   of the community. For such an exercise, we partitioned the variability
   of epiphytic communities growing in Lake St. Francois (Quebec) into
   various fractions explained by environmental variables, spatial
   structure, and covariation between environment and space. We described
   the epiphytic communities according to their fine (61 taxa) or coarse (6
   classes) taxonomy, their size structure, and their total biomass to
   identify which of these state variables could be most successfully
   modelled. Our analysis suggests that periphyton modelling could be
   improved by: 1) the measurement of physical and biotic factors as well
   as nutrients, 2) the consideration of microscale variation, and 3) the
   division of periphyton into functional groups based on coarse taxonomy

Abstract = {{We evaluated factors that influence food preference of the giant
   rams-horn snail Marisa cornuarietis for two aquatic macrophytes,
   Vallisneria americana and Ludwigia repens. The effects of pre-exposure
   and time-of-year on differences in consumption of plant species were
   determined by means of laboratory feeding trials. Snails had higher
   rates of ingestion in November 1991 than February 1992, but composition
   of diet was similar between dates. Marisa cornuarietis exhibited a
   distinct preference for L. repens following pre-exposure to both plants
   or to only V. americana. In contrast, pre-exposure to only L. repens
   resulted in equal consumption of both macrophytes. To gain insight to
   the factors producing these patterns of consumption, apparent
   digestibility (=ingestion - egestion) of plant materials was evaluated
   by additional feeding trials, and phytochemical characteristics of L.
   repens and V. americana were determined by laboratory analyses
   examining: 1) polar + nonpolar soluble (labile), 2) acid-soluble
   (=cellulose + hemicellulose), 3) acid insoluble (e.g., lignins), 4)
   total phenolics, and 5) ash contents. The consumption of L. repens in
   higher amounts may be due to the higher apparent digestibility of L.
   repens than V. americana. L. repens has a higher concentration of
   holocellulose, which appears to be readily digested. Plant phenolics and
   ash contents did not differ between plant species. V. americana is
   reported to have higher nutrient concentrations than L. repens, which
   may explain why M. cornuarietis consistently consumed V. americana even
   though the latter plant species has lower apparent digestibility than L.
   repens.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic characteristics were measured in artificial streams and in
   lst- to 5th-order streams in the Appalachian and Cascade mountains.
   Appalachian Mountain stream sites at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory,
   North Carolina, were on six 1st-order streams and a 1st- through
   4th-order gradient of Ball Creek-Coweeta Creek. Cascade Mountain sites
   were located on constrained and unconstrained reaches of Lookout Creek,
   a 5th-order stream in H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon. At each
   site, a tracer solution (chloride or rhodamine WT) was released for
   30-180 min and then discontinued. At the downstream end of the release
   site, the resulting rise and fall of the tracer concentration was
   measured. These data, along with upstream concentration and measured
   widths and depths, were used in a computer model to estimate several
   hydraulic parameters including transient storage and lateral inflow.
   Estimated transient storage zone size (A(s)) ranged from near zero in
   artificial streams to 2.0 m2 in 5th-order streams. A, was largest
   relative to surface cross-sectional area (A) at 1st-order sites where it
   averaged 1.2 x A, compared with 0.6 x A and 0.1 x A in unconstrained and
   constrained 5th-order sites, respectively. Where measured, lateral
   discharge inputs per metre of stream length ranged from 1.9\% of
   instream discharge in 1st-order streams to 0.05\% of instream discharge
   at 5th-order sites. Our results show that surface water exchange with
   storage zones is rapid and extensive in steep headwater streams and less
   extensive but still significant at 3rd- through 5th-order sites. An
   understanding of relationships between stream morphology, storage zone
   size, and extent of interactions between surface and subsurface waters
   will assist comparisons of solute dynamics in physically diverse
   streams.}},

   gradient, hydrologic variability, calcium concentration, physiographic
   province, and the presence or absence of a tide) had some predictive

   predictors of mussel distributions. Unexpectedly, several mussel species
   typically occurred in calcium-poor waters, which I tentatively interpret

Abstract = {{We studied the microhabitats of six species of freshwater mussels,
   including two rare species of Alasmidonta, in the Neversink River, New
   York. In each of 270, 1-m2 quadrats, we measured water depth, current
   speed, bottom roughness, spatial variation in current speed, distance to
   shore, presence or absence of macrophytes, presence or absence of an
   overhead canopy, the extent of patches of fine sediment, and sediment
   granulometry, as well as recording the mussels present. Mussel
   populations in the Neversink are dense (mean = 3.2/m2) and highly
   clumped. Stepwise discriminant analyses showed that current speed and
   spatial variation in current speed were the most useful predictors of
   the occurrence of mussels in quadrats. Alasmidonta heterodon was found
   most frequently at moderate current speeds and in quadrats that
   contained many patches of fine sediments. Alasmidonta varicosa occurred
   mort frequently at moderate current speeds and in sediments with a high
   proportion of medium sands (0.25-1 mm). Nevertheless, the predictive
   power of discriminant models based on microhabitat variables is ro low
   that we question the adequacy of a traditional microhabitat approach to
   unionacean ecology. We suggest that including geomorphological
   descriptors of the streambed or working at spatial scales of hundreds of
   metres might be more useful than a traditional microhabitat approach for
   predicting the distribution of freshwater mussels in streams.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the design and field-testing of a pre-positioned 1-m2
   electrofishing sampler with a novel electrode configuration. The sampler
   produces relatively uniform voltage gradients (0.36-7.00 mean volts/cm:
   water conductivity = 100 muMHO, 153 VAC, 600 W) that are sufficient to
   stun fish and are largely restricted to the sampling frame. Voltage
   gradients averaged 0.1 mean volts/cm 10 cm outside the frame regardless
   of water conductivity and declined exponentially with increasing
   distance from the frame. We compared the effectiveness of our sampler
   with adjacent kick-seine samples in the upper, middle, and lower regions
   of a riffle in Green River, Kentucky, using stratified random sampling.
   Species rank concordances were statistically similar regardless of
   method or habitat; both methods yielded similar information on benthic
   species composition. Statistically similar estimates of benthic fish
   abundance and number of benthic fish species were derived regardless of
   habitat or method. The frame sampler was more precise than kick-seining
   for estimates of fish density only in the upper riffle, a habitat
   characterized by relatively shallow water and small, more uniform
   substrate than found in other sampled habitats. Fewer frame samples (9)
   than kick-seine samples (17) were required to characterize species
   richness of the benthic fish fauna. In each habitat, more benthic
   species were collected using electrofishers than with kick-seines;
   Shannon's species diversity and evenness were larger when estimated from
   electrofishing samples than kick-seine samples in each habitat. We
   conclude that our sampler allows repeatable, equal-effort sampling of
   benthic species from well-defined sampling areas, small enough to allow
   fine-grained measurement of microhabitat. Importantly, this is achieved
   without producing voltage gradients strong enough to bias adjacent
   samples.}},

   reduced abundance biomass and secondary production of most invertebrate
   taxa. Streams draining Catchments 53 and 55 (C 53 and C 55) served as
   reference streams. During treatment, concentration of PIM in C 54
   decreased significantly from pretreatment levels for both instantaneous
   (grab) and continuous samples, while those of reference streams either
   increased or did not exhibit significant change. Maximum PIM
   concentrations, measured during rising hydrographs of storms, were over
   2 x greater in the reference streams than in C 54. During treatment of C
   54, export of PIM per unit maximum discharge (L/s) during sampling
   intervals (approximately 2 wks) decreased significantly compared with
   that of reference streams. Annual PIM export in reference streams
   displayed a strong (p < 0.002) exponential relationship with annual
   discharge, whereas that of the treated stream did not (p > 0.05). High
   discharges during post-treatment years (1989-1991) resulted in increased
   concentration and export of PIM in all streams. However, PIM
   concentrations in C 54 remained lower than those of the two reference
   streams.
   Invertebrate manipulation apparently reduced PIM export from C 54 by at
   least two mechanisms. First, the rate of particle generation by feeding
   activities was reduced. Second, invertebrate manipulation reduced rates
   of leaf litter processing, which resulted in increased storage of leaf
   litter and enhanced retention of particles. Comparisons of predicted
   versus measured export suggest that invertebrate manipulation in C 54
   reduced PIM export by approximately 76\%, or 550 (relative to C 53R) to
   > 1000 kg (relative to C 55) over the 6-yr treatment and post-treatment
   period. These comparisons exceed those made previously for the impact of
   invertebrate manipulation on FPOM export and provide another example of
   the link between animal communities and ecosystem processes. This study
   also provides evidence that stored leaf material, like that of woody
   debris, augments retention of inorganic particles in small headwater
   streams.}},

Abstract = {{The causes and consequences of habitat distribution of larvae of the
   mayfly Paraleptophlebia guttata were analyzed in a 2nd-order stream in
   west-central Kentucky. Among macrohabitats, larvae were typically
   significantly more dense in runs and riffles than in pools. Densities
   were positively related to the percentage of coarse substrata in
   macrohabitats, but were not correlated with current velocity, predatory
   fish densities, or the quantity of fine particulate organic matter
   (food) in macrohabitats. This relationship between density and
   substratum coarseness was further evidenced in an in-situ colonization
   experiment in which larvae selected gravel and pebble substrata over
   sand. Among microhabitats, larvae were more abundant in leaf litter and
   in gravel/pebble than in silt/sand. Laboratory manipulations showed that
   predation rates by fish were significantly lower on mayflies in leaf
   litter and gravel than in fine substrata. The combined effects of
   substratum particle size and fish predation determine habitat
   distributions of larvae.
   Larger larvae were more abundant in runs than in riffles, but larval
   growth rates in artificial stream channels were similar between current
   velocities simulating those in riffles and runs. These results, coupled
   with data from drift samples, suggest that larvae shifted macrohabitats
   with size. Size-related differences in macrohabitat use may reflect
   size-related changes in microhabitat use; larvae were significantly
   larger in leaf litter than in other microhabitats, and leaf litter
   amounts were greater in runs than in riffles.}},

   between spawning and larval release. Although unrelated to spatial
   aggregation, the number of ova carried by mussels varied with body size
   in a manner that suggests extremely late maturation followed by
   reproductive senescence in the largest mussels. Egg production was 1-2
   orders of magnitude greater than that of other poikilotherms of
   equivalent mass. Fertilization success was strongly correlated with
   spatial aggregation, with complete fertilization failure found at local

Abstract = {{We examined the role of nutrients in structuring algal periphyton
   communities in 12 softwater lakes varying widely in acidity by a)
   evaluating species composition on unenriched substrata in relation to
   water chemistry, and b) measuring the growth responses of dominant
   species within the communities of each lake to enrichment with eight
   combinations of N, P, and C.
   Species composition on substrata deployed for 5-6 wk in each lake was
   strongly related to pH and alkalinity, and relatively unresponsive to
   differences in either dissolved inorganic N (DIN) or total P in the
   water column, as determined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The
   limiting nutrient for at least some species, determined from their
   growth responses to nutrient enrichment, was in contrast closely related
   to water column nutrients. Low ratios of dissolved inorganic C (DIC) to
   DIN in the most acidic lakes were associated with an increase in the
   number of C-limited species, and with shifts from N limitation to C
   limitation of a few prevalent taxa. The N-fixing cyanophyte Nostoc
   commune was one of very few species to be frequently limited by the same
   nutrient (P) regardless of lake type. Although at least a portion of the
   periphyton community is clearly nutrient limited in these lakes during

Abstract = {{The accelerated impact of humankind on freshwater ecosystems over the

   between scientists and organizations for conservation and resource
   management has never been greater. The river conservation community has
   expanded its focus from recreational stream segments to promotion of
   ecosystem-based conservation policies at national and state levels.
   Scientists are moving beyond documentation of the deterioration of
   freshwater ecosystems towards application of their knowledge to
   management and restoration solutions. However, in spite of research,
   symposia and workshops, and new applied professional journals, much
   remains to be done.
   Here we review some of the challenges and opportunities for effective
   application of ecological information to solutions to environmental
   problems in aquatic systems. We focus on avenues for enhanced
   communication and cooperation between the scientific community and
   organizations for conservation and resource management. Specific
   recommendations include: (1) maintenance of regular communication
   between respective organizations through formal liaisons; (2)
   development of `State of the Science' papers focusing on key and timely
   conservation issues (e.g., hydropower, wetlands loss); (3) participation
   of scientists in selection of alternative management solutions to
   specific environmental problems, definition of biological criteria in
   evaluating solutions, and predictions of how the biological system will
   respond to alternative solutions; (4) review of the scientific content
   of documents developed by conservation and resource management groups;
   (5) development of a database that will serve as a clearinghouse of
   aquatic scientists who have expertise in specific areas; and (6)
   development of research priorities for specific sites or projects that
   will directly aid non-governmental organizations in the pursuit of
   conservation objectives and direct communication of these priorities to

Abstract = {{During more than 40 years of conservation activity, The Nature
   Conservancy has played an instrumental role in the protection of
   biodiversity by assessing the rarity of species and communities,
   tracking their locations and ecological status, and pursuing some form
   of conservation management for critical habitats. The acquisition of key
   private lands and subsequent management as nature preserves by
   Conservancy staff has proven to be an effective conservation approach.
   In response to an urgent need to seek biodiversity protection on larger
   landscapes, the organization is now shifting its focus to
   ecosystem-level conservation activities. This venture will largely
   depend upon: 1) partnerships developed with public-land managers and
   private landowners and 2) improved understanding of system
   interdependencies and ecosystem processes. `'Bio-hydrological'' studies
   which address the influences of hydrologic regimes on the character of
   biological communities are critically needed.}},

Abstract = {{The Sierra Club is a grassroots environmental organization that pursues
   its conservation agenda through lobbying, litigation, education, and
   electoral politics. The Club's major conservation campaigns are
   strengthened by the science-conservation connection, and include efforts
   to protect, enhance, and restore aquatic ecosystems such as the Great
   Lakes and the nation's wetlands. One of the Club's major conservation
   efforts over the past 20 years has been the campaign to restore
   Florida's Kissimmee River. After 20 years of effort following completion
   of channelization, a restoration plan was approved to backfill 47 km of
   the canal, restoring 130 km2 of ecosystem, including 90 km of the old
   river, over 11,500 ha of wetlands, and critical habitat for 300 species
   of fish and wildlife. The push for restoration, expected to take 10 to
   15 years and to cost as much as \$422 million, benefitted from
   cooperation and involvement from scientists and lay-people alike.
   Research indicated that ecological integrity of the Kissimmee River
   could be restored only with a holistic approach to the form and function
   of the former ecosystem. The Kissimmee River restoration campaign is an
   excellent example of scientists and conservationists using their
   combined skills to change public policy and to benefit the environment.
   The Sierra Club's call to NABS members and to other scientists is to not
   to stop here, but to continue and develop this fruitful relationship in
   pursuit of common conservation goals.}},

Abstract = {{The Forest Service (FS) of the US Department of Agriculture and Trout
   Unlimited (TU) implemented a national partnership in 1987 to enhance the
   conservation and management of coldwater fisheries and their ecosystems.
   Professional fisheries scientists and conservation volunteers work
   together across the United States to manage, enhance, and monitor a
   world-class fisheries resource. Fisheries resources on National Forest
   System lands include habitats on some 161,000 km of waterways, 890,000
   ha of lakes and 26,500 km of coastline, amount to about 50\% of all the
   trout and salmon habitat in the US This unique national partnership
   spans some 475 TU chapters involving 70,000 volunteers working on 125
   National Forests and 682 Ranger Districts providing a formidable work
   force for conservation activities. Since the FS-TU agreement took place,
   local and regional supplemental agreements have been implemented in 22
   states covering 22 TU councils (274 chapters) and 99 National Forests
   (483 Ranger Districts). TU has become an effective partner and a prime
   supporter in getting management and budgetary reform built into the FS
   `'Rise to the Future'' national fisheries program. The FS and TU have
   effectively bridged the gap between former `'outside'' partners, and are
   now working partners or shareholders for the benefit of coldwater
   fisheries resource management. TU has become more technically aware and
   educated in fisheries management, and the FS has benefitted from more
   public involvement and concern for the resource. `'Involved''
   partnerships have helped foster better stewardship for management of
   coldwater fisheries resources across the nation in National Forest

Abstract = {{Within a few months of its founding in 1870, the tradition of
   science-based advocacy in the American Fisheries Society (AFS) was
   established. The American Fish Culturist's Association, as it was then
   called, lodged protests with the U.S. State Department and Canada
   against obstructions in the St. Lawrence River that restricted the
   migration of salmon. Prompt response was obtained. In addition to
   resource advocacy, as a professional society our mission encompasses
   scientific development and professional service objectives. Throughout
   its history the Society has done an excellent job of building fisheries
   science through gathering and disseminating information, recognizing
   educational, scientific, and technical accomplishments, and establishing
   standards for the fisheries profession. The result of our science-based
   advocacy has been less distinguished-we have documented the decline of
   fish populations and the loss of supporting fish habitats as human
   population expansion and attendant resource development has occurred. In
   recognition of this failure, 92\% of the Society's membership surveyed
   in 1986 gave medium or high priority to more active participation by AFS
   in developing environmental policy. The Society has since increased its
   advocacy and lobbying activities. We support agency fishery program
   budgets, develop legislation, and comment on legislative initiatives of
   others. We have formed a coalition of fishermen to conserve habitat;
   sponsored the Mississippi Interjurisdictional Cooperative Resources
   Agreement; and launched the Fisheries Action Network. We recognize that
   if AFS is to participate in bringing about a reversal of the declines
   cited above, the Society must put scientific facts into a context of
   environmental ethics and shared community values to effectively and
   clearly communicate the fishery consequences of decisions on the
   management of land and water resources.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the fauna of the Rio Claro on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica,
   including snails, fishes, and freshwater shrimp, migrates upstream,
   sometimes in large aggregations. We investigated the dynamics of the
   migratory behavior of the snails Neritina latissima and Cochliopina
   tryoniana, which both migrate upstream in huge, mixed aggregations
   (>500,000 individuals) during the dry season. Yet these two species have
   very different life histories. Neritina latissima has pelagic larvae
   which are swept downstream to the ocean. Metamorphosed individuals
   migrate upstream. Cochliopina tryoniana has direct development, with no
   marine stage. We analyzed the size distribution of the migrating,
   stationary, and drifting portions of the populations of these two
   species. In the drift, we collected only larval N. latissima. Analysis
   of the size distribution of the migrating and stationary snails
   suggested that the migration takes >1 yr for N. latissima and perhaps <1
   yr for C. tryoniana. In both species, the migration behavior was size
   and age dependent. Juveniles and small adults composed the bulk of the
   migrating populations, whereas large adults were almost never observed
   to migrate. The mean size of individuals in migrating aggregations
   increased over time and distance upstream. Sphoeroides annulatus, a
   marine molluscivorous fish, was found only in the lower reaches of the
   stream. Where S. annulatus was common, N. latissima was less abundant
   and located on the underside of rocks. The distance migrated may be a
   balance between size-dependent energetic constraints on upstream
   movement and increased predation pressure downstream.}},

   Branch, Tennessee over a 13-mo period are reported in this study. The
   most abundant bryophyte in Walker Branch during 1990-1991 was the leafy
   liverwort Porella pinnata, followed by the mosses Brachythecium cf.
   campestra and Amblystegium sp. Bryophyte abundance peaked in late summer
   and was reduced by a severe winter storm. Abundance was positively
   associated with stable substrate types (bedrock, boulders) and channel
   units characterized by rapid water velocity (bedrock steps, riffles).
   Where present, Porella exhibited significantly greater area-specific
   rates of photosynthesis and phosphorus uptake than periphyton,
   irrespective of site or season. Biomass-specific rates also were greater
   for Porella in fall; in winter and spring, however, periphyton on
   cobbles (but not on introduced cylinders) had significantly greater
   biomass-specific photosynthetic and phosphorus uptake rates. When these
   data are extrapolated to the entire 925-m2 sampling reach, taking into
   account the patchy distribution of Porella, photosynthesis and

Abstract = {{Floodplains of large alluvial rivers are often expansive and
   characterized by high volume hyporheic flow through lattice-like
   substrata, probably formed by glacial outwash or lateral migration of
   the river channel over long time periods. River water downwells into the
   floodplain at the upstream end; and, depending on bedrock geomorphology
   and other factors, groundwater from the unconfined aquifer upwells
   directly into the channel or into floodplain springbrooks at rates
   determined by head pressure of the water mass moving through the
   floodplain hydrologic system. These large scale (km3) hyporheic zones
   contain speciose food webs, including specialized insects with hypogean
   and epigean life history stages (amphibionts) and obligate groundwater
   species (stygobionts). Biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone
   may naturally load ground-waters with bioavailable solutes that appear
   to exert proximal controls on production and biodiversity of surface
   benthos and riparian vegetation. The effect is especially evident in
   floodplain springbrooks. Dynamic convergence of aquifer-riverine
   components adds physical heterogeneity and functional complexity to
   floodplain landscapes. Because reaches of aggraded alluvium and
   attendant ecotonal processes occur serially, like beads on a string,
   along the river continuum, we propose the concept of a hyporheic
   corridor in alluvial rivers. We expect predictable zonation of
   groundwater communities and other aquifer-riverine convergence
   properties within the corridor from headwaters to river mouth. The
   landscape-level significance and connectivity of processes along the
   hyporheic corridor must be better understood if river ecosystems,
   especially those involving large floodplain components, are to be
   protected and/or rehabilitated.}},

Abstract = {{The term `'hyporheic zone'' is gaining wide usage among those interested
   in processes and patterns within the stream bed and floodplain
   sediments. Because of differences in terminologies, methodologies, and
   dogma among biologists, hydrologists, geomorphologists, and chemists,
   there is no single, conceptual definition of the hyporheic zone. The
   hyporheic zone has been defined by distributions of epigean organisms,
   hypogean organisms, epigean-hypogean associations, nutrients, organic
   matter, temperature, underflow paths, etc. Conceptual cross-sectional
   and longitudinal models have been presented for a number of individual
   research sites. Hydrologically, the hyporheic zone is established by
   channel water advection and may be defined as a `'middle zone'' between
   channel waters above and groundwaters (if present) below. In expanding
   this definition to include other disciplines, researchers should
   explicitly state their own working definitions when reporting research.
   There is a need to begin incorporating hyporheic processes into present
   lotic paradigms and to develop more interdisciplinary conceptual
   frameworks that will facilitate hypothesis testing and cross-system and
   intra-system comparisons. Development and refinement of hyporheic
   research must evolve from greater dialogue among researchers in all the

Abstract = {{Our understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of the distribution

   both cases, there are strong correlations between direction and
   magnitude of hydrologic fluxes and the composition of hyporheic
   invertebrate assemblages. Hydrologists are likely to find that the
   distribution and abundance of hyporheos will provide useful
   corroborative data in studies of hyporheic flow dynamics, while
   ecologists should recognize the effects of hydrologic exchange between
   the surface stream and the hyporheic zone at a variety of scales. Thus
   hydrologic measurements of surface water and ground-water exchange
   should be included routinely in future studies of hyporheic invertebrate
   ecology. Such exchange controls the availability of nutrients, food, and

Abstract = {{Increased experimentation is essential if we are to understand the
   biotically rich hyporheic zone and how it influences processes in other
   parts of lotic systems. Unique challenges face experimenters because the
   hyporheic zone is both extremely complex hydrologically and relatively
   inaccessible and difficult to manipulate. I discuss five major obstacles
   that impede experimental progress in hyporheic research and I suggest
   corollary experiments or technical developments that are critical to our
   future research agenda. The first obstacle is that a conceptualization
   of the hyporheic zone, in which there are clearly definable boundaries
   that apply across all streams, is unlikely because of significant
   variations in geology and hydrology between drainage basins. How this
   zone is delineated may depend on the experimental question and we should
   `'exploit'' cross-system differences to motivate experiments. Second,
   developing methods of obtaining deep streambed samples in an undisturbed
   fashion, from defined positions within the streambed, and evaluating the
   effect of our experimental intervention on the process under study
   requires serious effort. Third, evaluating the impact of bed movement on
   hyporheic processes and quantifying or controlling for this movement in
   experiments will require new or modified techniques. Fourth, developing
   methods for quantifying and experimentally manipulating subsurface flows
   should be an essential part of research to determine how these flows
   influence system and community-level processes. This will require
   adaptation of existing techniques for measuring subsurface flows, so
   that they are useable at a variety of spatial scales, and simulation of
   subsurface flows in artificial streams and in-stream chambers. Fifth,
   the nature and extent to which a hyporheic component or ecological
   process is influenced by surface vs. groundwater inputs must be
   quantified. This will require the ability to separate surface from
   groundwater effects by means of experimental manipulation or design.}},

Abstract = {{Hyporheic zone research is an area of rapidly growing interest in stream
   ecology. Several key points have emerged as important for consideration
   of future research in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic researchers need to
   outline explicitly the spatial scale of their own research, from single
   sampling locations to entire catchments, and how research at this
   examined scale relates to finer or larger scaled processes. Spatial and
   temporal scale considerations are also important when planning sampling
   and experimental manipulations of hyporheic processes. Stream
   researchers need to examine the importance of the hyporheic zone as a
   boundary or ecotone that potentially controls or contributes to surface
   water and groundwater ecosystem dynamics. Inclusion of hydrologic
   considerations in the research design and analysis of hyporheic
   processes is a promising approach that will help elevate hyporheic
   research from a descriptive science to a predictive one, and may help to
   make future cross-system comparisons possible.}},

Abstract = {{Retention of water and particulate organic matter (leaves and wood) was
   studied experimentally in Juday Creek, a 3rd-order woodland stream in
   northern Indiana. Fluorescein dye and 1500 Ginkgo leaves were released
   into each of nine 50-m reaches classified into three reach types based
   on the quantity and arrangement of large woody debris (LWD). Reaches
   with accumulations of LWD (debris dams) retained water, based on nominal
   transport times, 1.5-1.7x longer than the channelized (non-woody)
   reaches with minimal LWD. Reaches with LWD located only along channel
   margins (edge wood) were intermediate in hydraulic retention. Average
   leaf travel distances increased from 109 m (debris dam) to 125 m (edge
   wood) and 168 m (non-woody) as the amount of reach LWD decreased. Fifty
   wood dowels were released into debris dam reaches and non-woody reaches.
   Wood traveled an average of 14 m in debris dam reaches compared with 183
   m in non-woody reaches. The most important retention structures for
   leaves and wood, besides debris dams, were stream margins, roots of
   riparian vegetation, sticks, and single LWD pieces. Although midwestern
   streams typically have much lower LWD loads than many coniferous forest
   streams, such LWD provides important sites for organic matter retention
   and processing.}},

Abstract = {{A longitudinal succession of species of Hydropsyche along a stream
   continuum is a common pattern in Palearctic as well as in Nearctic
   regions. Using a laboratory channel, we studied the relationship between
   current velocity and six Hydropsyche species distributed from small
   streams to large rivers in the Rhone Basin (France). Different phases of
   net-building behaviour were used to test the reactions of larvae to
   variations in current speed over a range of 4-40 cm/s. Hydropsyche
   angustipennis had more than 30\% of its larvae wandering at the end of
   the experiment and was the least adapted species to the experimental
   conditions; the proportion of wandering larvae for the other five
   species was less than 10\%. The largest proportion of catchnets with
   regular meshes occurred at velocities between 28 and 40 cm/s for the
   upstream species (H. siltalai and H. angustipennis) and for a species of
   the middle reaches of stream (H. pellucidula). Another middle-reach
   species (H. exocellata) had the highest proportion of catchnets with
   regular meshes between 8 and 40 cm/s, and for the downstream species (H.
   contubernalis and H. modesta), this proportion occurred at 15 cm/s. Our
   results suggest that the species are ordered in a downstream sequence
   according to their ability to spin a normal catchnet when the natural
   current velocity decreases. Downstream species seem to be more tolerant
   than upstream species to low-velocity conditions that may occur over

Abstract = {{Considerable annual variation in precipitation and stream discharge
   occurred during a 5-yr study of the abundance and size-structure of
   Simulium spp., Hydropsyche betteni, and Cheumatopsyche spp. larvae. All
   three taxa exhibited dramatic increases in density associated with
   increased precipitation and elevated stream discharge. However, Simulium
   spp. and the two hydropsychid taxa exhibited different seasonal
   occurrences of early larval instars and peak larval abundance. Simulium
   spp. produced larval propagules as early as May and continued the
   production of new larval cohorts throughout the summer, with highest
   density occurring in May-June. In contrast, H. betteni and
   Cheumatopsyche spp. produced only one cohort of larval propagules during
   summer, beginning in June and July, with the highest density in
   July-August. Short-term (24-d) experimental manipulations of flow regime
   in a riffle during spring (May-June) and summer (July-August) showed
   that elevated stream discharge had a strong, positive effect on
   filter-feeder colonization during both seasons. Taxonomic composition
   and temporal variation in colonization of filter feeders differed
   dramatically, however, in spring and summer. In spring, only Simulium
   spp. colonized rock surfaces; because of their rapid development,
   pupation, and emergence, they exhibited large temporal variation in
   abundance, particularly under elevated discharge. In summer, Simulium
   spp., H. betteni, and Cheumatopsyche spp. all colonized rock surfaces.
   However, H. betteni was the predominant colonist and its relatively slow
   developmental rate resulted in reduced temporal variation in
   filter-feeder abundance. These results indicate the colonization,
   temporal persistence, and taxonomic composition of filter feeders in
   riffles is strongly influenced by the life history characteristics of
   the taxa, particularly their timing of propagule production and
   subsequent developmental rate, and the temporal distribution and
   magnitude of discharge in the stream.}},

   whereas the qualitative protocol differed from the others in both
   habitats sampled and sampling effort. We determined differences among
   protocols for 18 attributes of invertebrate assemblages using data from
   yearly benthic samples (1986-1989) in three Tennessee River tributaries:
   Clinch, Powell, and Sequatchie rivers. Conditions differed among those
   rivers as reflected by fish assemblages (using the index of biotic
   integrity-IBI).
   We found distinct differences among the protocols and among many of the
   attributes selected for evaluation. Ten attributes either did not differ
   (stonefly and intolerant snail and mussel taxa richnesses, dominance,
   and proportions of omnivores, gatherers, grazers, and predators), or
   exhibited consistent differences (proportions of filterers, shredders,
   and chironomids), between riffles and pools. Of these ten attributes,
   six (stonefly taxa richness, dominance, and proportions of chironomids,
   filterers, omnivores, and predators) exhibited trends that coincided
   with our expectations based on fish assemblage condition. Eight
   attributes exhibited spatial and/or temporal trends that differed
   between riffles and pools (total, mayfly, caddisfly, and
   sediment-surface taxa richnesses, proportions of Corbicula,
   detritivores, and oligochaetes, and total abundance). When interyear
   differences among protocols were detected, trends among sites in pools,
   but not riffles, matched our expectations based on the biological
   condition of the fish assemblages (exception-the proportion of
   detritivores). Thus, monitoring programs may reach conclusions that are
   biased if biological condition is assessed with many commonly used
   attributes (e.g., total and mayfly taxa richnesses) and sampling is
   restricted to only one habitat. None of the taxa richness attributes
   (e.g., total and mayfly) distinguished differences among rivers in the
   multihabitat, qualitative protocol even though taxa counts were
   generally higher than in samples from either pools or riffles.
   Consequently, unreplicated, qualitative sampling may not have sufficient
   statistical power to detect subtle differences among streams.
   Replicated, quantitative sampling in both riffles and pools interpreted
   through a variety of biological attributes provides the strongest
   assessment of biological condition based on invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Influences of the transmission properties of the riparian canopy and the
   water column on spectral irradiance and periphyton composition were
   examined at four sites in Otter Creek, a small spring-fed stream in the
   Sand Hills region of western Nebraska. Values for per cent sky in the
   canopy at the four sites were: 65.1\% (open site), 31.9\% (partial
   shade), 19.0\% (shade), and 15.4\% (heavy shade). Above canopy, below
   canopy, and underwater irradiances were measured at 2-nm intervals from
   300-800 nm in late morning, mid-day, early afternoon, and late afternoon
   at each site on a clear day (13 June 1991).
   Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) incident at the stream surface
   did not consistently correspond to per cent sky values at the sites
   because of temporal changes in the penetration of direct sun through
   small openings in the canopy (sunflecks). The relationship of solar path
   to canopy structure and orientation was the primary determinant of
   sunfleck activity. There was very little absorbance of specific
   wavelengths by the canopy at the open site, but the proportion of blue
   light (400-500 nm) increased at all sites by late afternoon. At the
   three shaded sites, the amount of red light (600-700 nm) was
   proportionally lower underneath the canopy than above it. Underwater PAR
   was always greater at the open site than at the more shaded sites, but
   the relationship between canopy cover and underwater irradiance for the
   more shaded sites varied temporally. The spectral distribution of PAR at
   the mean depth in Otter Creek (39.7 cm) was similar to that found at
   shallow depths in clear, oligotrophic lakes, in that there was only a
   slight maximum transmission in green wavelengths (approximately 550 nm).
   The degree of temporal variability in the underwater spectral
   distribution at a site was often greater than differences between sites
   because of the effects of sunflecks and surface reflection by ripples.
   Algal chlorophyll a concentrations at the sites were significantly
   correlated with per cent sky for gravel substrata but not for sand
   substrata. The flora on both substrata was dominated by diatoms, and the
   distributions of several species were related to the degree of canopy
   cover at the sites. The relative importance of the spectral light field
   versus total PAR in structuring benthic lotic assemblages warrants
   further study.}},

Abstract = {{Longitudinal gradients in streamwater nutrient concentrations in Walker
   Branch are generated as a result of instream nutrient uptake and
   spatially confined groundwater inputs during the period from November to
   May. The response of the stream periphyton community to these
   longitudinal nutrient reductions was determined by measuring periphyton
   biomass, productivity, species composition, and phosphorus (P) cycling
   indices at four stations along a longitudinal transect in the stream.
   Phosphorus cycling indices (chlorophyll-specific phosphatase activity,
   phosphorus content of periphyton) exhibited significant changes along
   the longitudinal transect during those times of the year when
   streamwater soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations also
   decreased along the transect. During the period from June to October,
   however, neither streamwater phosphorus concentrations nor phosphorus
   cycling characteristics exhibited longitudinal trends. Regressions
   between phosphatase activity and streamwater SRP concentration and
   between phosphorus content and streamwater SRP were highly significant
   for all data combined, with SRP explaining greater-than-or-equal-to 74\%
   of the variation in phosphatase activity and P content.
   Measures of periphyton biomass (chlorophyll a, total biovolume), and
   productivity (areal carbon fixation rate, chlorophyll-specific carbon
   fixation rate) exhibited no consistent longitudinal patterns, even
   during the period of longitudinal streamwater phosphorus depletion.
   Regressions between productivity measures and streamwater SRP
   concentration for all data combined were significant, but SRP explained
   less-than-or-equal-to 56\% of the variation in productivity. Periphyton
   biomass and productivity at all stations along the longitudinal transect
   appear to be maintained at low levels by high and longitudinally uniform
   rates of herbivory throughout the year. Algal species composition
   exhibited some response to longitudinal nutrient depletion. The
   biovolume and percentage of the blue-green alga Chamaesiphon investiens
   increased and the percentage of the chlorophyte Stigeoclonium sp.
   declined longitudinally when nutrients also declined.
   Our results demonstrate an upstream-downstream biotic linkage in Walker
   Branch. We show that instream nutrient uptake can reduce the
   concentrations of nutrients in stream water and thereby influence the
   structure and functioning of downstream periphyton communities. However,
   increases in nutrient cycling in response to lower streamwater
   concentrations can partially compensate for nutrient depletion by
   upstream organisms, thereby buffering primary productivity in downstream
   periphyton communities from changes in nutrient supply.}},

   Neophylax from White Oak Creek were given one of four diets in
   laboratory streams: (1) low-biomass periphyton (from White Oak Creek),
   (2) high-biomass periphyton (from an unshaded, nutrient-enriched stream
   that lacked effective grazers), (3) low-biomass periphyton and leaves,
   and (4) high-biomass periphyton and leaves. Small Elimia grew 2x faster
   and large Elimia grew 5x faster on high-biomass periphyton than on their
   normal diet of low-biomass periphyton. Neophylax grew 7x faster on the
   high-biomass periphyton. The high-biomass periphyton also produced
   significantly higher ratios of lipid to ash-free dry mass for both
   grazers. Leaf additions did not increase growth or lipid accumulation,
   even for Elimia, a feeding generalist. Measurements of grazer growth in
   situ closely matched those obtained on low-biomass periphyton in the
   laboratory, indicating few laboratory artifacts. The degree of Elimia's
   food limitation was size-specific: growth stimulation by high-biomass
   periphyton was much more pronounced for large snails than for small
   snails, and large snails had lower lipid reserves after feeding on
   low-biomass periphyton than did small snails. Food limitation appears to
   be a chronic condition for grazers in streams like White Oak Creek,

   (clear-cut), Mack Creek (old-growth coniferous forest), and Quartz Creek
   (second-growth) in Oregon were photographed using scanning electron
   microscopy, and their surface area was calculated by assuming spherical
   or cylindrical shapes. In Grasshopper Creek, FPOM cylinders (n = 326)
   represented 89\% of the total surface area (124.9 m2) and 68\% of the
   total FPOM numbers. In Mack Creek, FPOM cylinders (n = 231) contributed
   77\% of the total surface area (114.2 m2) even though they represented
   only 55\% of the total numbers. In Quartz Creek, FPOM cylinders (n =

   differences are likely due to the differences in riparian vegetation.
   The importance of FPOM surface area to physical, chemical, and

   in Mill Creek, Virginia, a first-order stream in the Central Appalachian
   Ridges and Valleys ecoregion. Each adult female laid approximately 230
   eggs which hatched in 13 d. Five larval instars were recorded with most
   individuals overwintering in instars III and IV. Pupation and emergence
   occurred primarily over a 6-wk period in May and June. No mortality in
   the egg stage was detected, while high mortality in instar I (92.9\%)
   was due partly to sibling cannibalism. Instars II-V showed constant low
   mortality, with high mortality again in the pupal stage; 0.5\% of the
   original eggs survived to adulthood. Growth analysis revealed two
   distinct growth phases: one from hatching through instar IV (0.007 mg/d)
   and a much faster growth rate for instar V in May (0.148 mg/d).
   Production estimates for the entire generation ranged from approximately
   3 to 5 g/m2 and were highly variable. On a per-day basis, production
   occurred at specific times of the year. Yield per day peaked slightly
   later than peaks in production. High daily production occurred
   immediately after hatching as a result of growth of many small
   individuals. At the end of the generation, there was another period of
   high daily production due to fast growth by fewer larger individuals.
   Most production occurred from March through June. At other times, daily
   production was relatively low. It may be more accurate to estimate
   production by predicting biomass from survivorship and growth functions
   than directly from sample data.}},

   mixed woodland of Alberta, Canada. At both streams, two sampling designs
   were used concurrently: (1) simultaneous placement and sequential
   removal of substrata, and (2) sequential placement and simultaneous
   removal of substrata. Three hypotheses were tested: there was no
   difference in the density of macroinvertebrates or quantity of
   chlorophyll a (1) on rough and smooth tiles, (2) for different
   colonization periods (1-14 d), and (3) for both sampling designs.
   Density of most macroinvertebrates and the quantity of chlorophyll a was
   greater on the rough tiles in both sampling designs and in both streams.
   Both sampling designs gave consistent results for the effect of texture
   for most taxa over eight colonization periods. Similar results for the
   sampling designs and in both streams provide strong evidence for the
   importance of substratum texture in streams. Some macroinvertebrate
   colonization patterns indicated early and late colonizers, while other
   patterns indicated no colonization trend. Several taxa showed similar

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted at three locations in the Lower Salmon River,
   Idaho (USA) and at one Upper Salmon ``calibration{''} site to extend
   results of previous research (headwater through 5-6th-order {[}1-814
   links] streams) to an 8th-order (15,000 links) river. Transported
   organic matter (TOM) generally increased downstream. Coarse TOM was
   prevalent only in the upper 50 km of the system, and ultrafine was the
   predominant particulate component throughout the system. Stored
   (benthic) organic matter (OM) was highest in the headwaters and showed a
   progressive downstream decrease. The headwaters were highly retentive of
   coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) but much less so of the fine
   and ultrafine fractions. Transported and stored OM approached a balance
   only in the lowermost (deeper) reaches of the river system. Analyses of
   the components of ecosystem metabolism revealed that gross primary
   production and respiration (R) both showed a general downstream
   increase. Overall, the net metabolism measurements showed that R was
   predominant in the upstream reaches, autotrophy prevailed in the middle
   reaches, and R was again predominant at the farthest downstream site.
   Insect functional feeding-group patterns apparently were altered in
   their relative abundances from that predicted by the River Continuum
   Concept by lower than expected deciduous CPOM-loading in the headwaters
   and high sediment transport into the mid-reaches from a major tributary
   (East Fork). Although shredders were prevalent in headwater reaches,
   they were less abundant than predicted. Gatherers were dominant in the
   upper reaches and filterers in the mid-sized reaches above East Fork.
   Scrapers increased progressively downstream in relative abundance.
   Spiraling and retention measurements revealed a general downstream
   increase in the rate of movement of OM; turnover length of carbon
   increased progressively downstream. The ratio of mean water velocity:
   rate of downstream movement of OM indicated that the export of organic
   carbon was reduced 3500-fold in headwaters relative to that of mean
   water velocity whereas the lower reaches behaved more like a conduit
   with carbon atoms passing through at a rate comparable to water
   velocity. In spite of the cold and arid climate in which the Salmon
   River Basin is located and the low allochthonous input from deciduous
   plants, the data generally support the basic premises of the
   River-Continuum Concept.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the role of macrofauna consumers in organic matter dynamics of
   headwater streams, we applied seasonal insecticide treatments to a
   southern Appalachian Mountain stream and compared benthic community
   structure between this and two other streams. Production was estimated
   in the two major habitats: mixed cobble-gravel-sand substrate and
   bedrock outcrop. Using the proportional availability of the habitats in
   each stream, production over the entire stream was measured.
   Annual habitat-weighted production in the untreated streams during the
   two study years ranged from 8.9 to 14.0 g AFDM m-2 yr-1, 81 to 86\%, of
   which was attributed to insects. Habitat-weighted production was
   distributed rather evenly among the collector-gatherer (32-41\%),
   shredder (23-31\%), and predator (28-33\%) functional groups.
   Collector-filterer and scraper groups accounted for less than 9\% of
   total habitat-weighted production in all three streams.
   Insecticide applications resulted in dramatic changes in the macrofaunal
   community. Annual habitat-weighted production (4.4 g m-1 yr-1) in the
   treated stream decreased by 62\% from Yr 1 to Yr 2, with insects
   contributing only 45\% to total production. Oligochaetes, several
   Diptera, dragonflies, and copepods composed most of the production
   during treatment. Although habitat-weighted production of all functional
   groups was lower in the treatment year than in the pre-treatment year,
   collector-gatherer production decreased the least (21\% reduction) and
   dominated overall production during treatment. Production of the other
   functional groups decreased by 71-94\% between the two years. The
   changes in macrofaunal community structure and production observed in
   the insecticide treated stream were much greater than between-year
   changes in the reference stream, despite the occurrence of a record
   drought in Yr 2. The effect of the two different disturbances on overall
   production differed not only in magnitude but also in direction, with
   production in the reference stream increasing (12\% over Yr 1) during
   the drought year.
   Resource ingestion was estimated using values of functional group
   production. Estimates of ingestion suggested that the major functional
   groups were ingesting a fairly large portion of available resources in
   the untreated streams. Collector-gatherers consumed 34-64\% of total
   annual habitat-weighted fine particulate organic matter. Shredders
   consumed an estimated 28-47\% of average annual standing crop of leaves,
   and predators ingested 67-79\% of total macrofaunal production.
   Insecticide treatments resulted in much lower levels of resource
   ingestion: 26\%, 4\%, and 50\% for collector-gatherers, shredders, and
   predators, respectively.
   Our results show the importance of using estimates of production when
   assessing disturbance effects on macrofaunal communities, since
   abundances greatly underestimated the impact of insecticide treatments.
   Biomass estimates, though providing better measures of disturbance than
   abundances, tended to overestimate overall macrofaunal losses because of
   the disproportionate influence of large, slow growing taxa such as
   crayfish.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new method for estimating the distance that fine
   particulate organic matter (FPOM) is transported in streams. Corn pollen
   (diameter = 87-mu-m, rho = 1092 kg/m3) was injected into Dry Brook, a
   2nd-order stream in Allegany State Park, New York. Loss of pollen from
   the water column was measured by filtering pollen from approximately
   250-mL grab samples, staining with basic function, and counting. Loss
   rates were fit to an exponential decay function; mean travel distances
   on three release dates ranged from 122 to 190 m, consistent with
   predictions of a model that assumes particle loss is proportional to the
   settling velocity of a particle in still water and the depth of the
   water column. Pollen, as a seston analog, would provide a comparative
   tool to measure transport in streams that differ in critical geomorphic
   and hydraulic characteristics. This technique can be applied to
   questions on how bed structure and near-bed flow affect retention and

Abstract = {{Egg development was investigated for Hexagenia limbata (Serville) from
   Southern Indian Lake (SIL) in northern Manitoba, Canada. The SIL
   population is located near the northern range limit of H. limbata, and
   some important differences in hatching dynamics were seen in comparison
   with southern populations. Hatching success and egg development time
   were related to temperature, as reported in the south, but the
   developmental threshold temperature for the SIL population was near
   8-degrees-C, 2-degrees tower than previously reported. Storage of the
   eggs at 8-degrees-C resulted in slow but measurable development rather
   than low-temperature quiescence as expected, leading to inconsistent
   degree-day estimation among temperature treatments. Following storage at
   8-degrees-C, both egg development rate and hatching success increased
   with increasing temperature. However, hatching success was improved by
   increasing the time the eggs spent in storage, ranging from only 50\%
   hatch in unstored eggs to > 90\% hatch in eggs stored for approximately
   6 mo. In addition, a bimodal hatching response was seen in the eggs;
   about half of the eggs deposited by individual females hatched
   immediately under favourable conditions, and the remainder hatched after
   exposure to cold (4-degrees-C). A lower developmental threshold than
   previously reported and a previously undescribed egg diapause may enable

   N-2 (67-degrees-38'27{''}N, 149-degrees-37'30{''}W) was studied during
   six years of experimental fertilization. The dominant snail, Lymnaea
   elodes, increased on the fertilized side of the lake. Another snail,
   Valvata lewisi, previously shown to be competitively inferior to
   Lymnaea, did not increase in the fertilized sector until the fifth year
   of the study, but then increased dramatically. Chironomids were more
   abundant and had higher biomass on the reference side of the lake, an
   initial condition, and did not increase in the fertilized sector. Slimy
   sculpin, previously shown to control chironomids on bare sediments in
   nearby Toolik Lake, were the only fish predators on chironomids in Lake
   N-2; they did not grow faster in the fertilized sector. These results
   suggest that the dominant benthic invertebrates in N-2, chironomids and
   snails, were limited by different factors; chironomids were not food
   limited and appeared to be limited by predators, but snails, free from
   predation in N-2, appeared food limited. The planktonic model of
   cascading trophic interactions, if applied to benthic communities, would
   predict that, at low (zero) piscivore density, sculpin density and/or
   growth would increase as increased primary productivity was passed up
   the food web; they did not. The physical structure of the benthic zone
   is such that edible food can accumulate, whereas this cannot occur over
   extended time scales in planktonic systems. I suggest that this
   structural difference leads to functionally different constraints on
   planktonic and benthic communities.}},

Abstract = {{Diel relationships between physical and chemical parameters and biomass
   were examined along a 57-km reach of Whitewood Creek, South Dakota,
   between 29 August and 2 September 1988. A time lag of approximately 3-6
   h for fluctuations in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations
   (ranging from 0.1 to 0.5-mu-M at the downstream sites) relative to
   dissolved arsenic (ranging from 0.3 to 1.2-mu-M as arsenate (pentavalent
   arsenic)) was consistent with our laboratory studies (reported
   elsewhere) showing preferential cell sorption of orthophosphate over
   arsenate by creek periphyton. The potential biological effects on SRP
   diel fluctuations contrasts with abiotic sorption controls for dissolved
   arsenate (a chemically similar anion). Cycles for pH, like water
   temperature cycles, lagged irradiance cycles by 1-3 h. Like pH, the
   amplitude of dissolved arsenic diel cycles was greatest at the site with
   most abundant biomass. Diel fluctuations in specific conductance (an
   indicator of groundwater inputs at elevated conductivity relative to the
   water column) were out of phase with both SRP and dissolved arsenic
   concentrations suggesting that groundwater was not the direct source of

Abstract = {{The relationship of growth form to phosphorus uptake, carbon fixation,
   and susceptibility to grazing was tested in stream algae, We
   hypothesized that algal species with high surface area: volume (SA:V)
   ratios would have higher biomass-specific rates of nutrient uptake and
   photosynthesis than species with low SA:V ratios. We also predicted that
   algal species with gelatinous or prostrate growth forms would have low
   susceptibility to grazing. Physiological measurements were made using
   ten taxa comprising five different algal growth forms commonly found in
   flowing waters (unbranched filamentous; branched filamentous;
   gelatinous, branched filamentous; gelatinous, colonial; and prostrate).
   Significant positive relationships were obtained between SA:V and
   phosphorus uptake, and SA:V and carbon fixation at high light
   (200-mu-mol quanta m-2 s-1), but only after two outlying taxa were
   deleted from the analysis. A significant regression was obtained between
   SA:V and carbon fixation at low light (20-mu-mol quanta m-2 s-1) when
   all ten taxa were included. Herbivore preference for different growth
   forms was assessed in a short-term experiment which compared the amount
   of algae in snail feces vs. that on substrates. The ranking for least
   preferred to most preferred growth form was: gelatinous (colonial) =
   unbranched filamentous (Oedogonium) < prostrate < unbranched filamentous
   (Fragilaria), The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that the functional attributes of lotic algae are related to their
   growth form. However, other factors beside growth form also can
   influence the functional performance and, by inference, the distribution
   of lotic algae in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial substrata are increasingly used to study periphyton, but
   their ability to reproduce natural substrata remains controversial.
   Although many studies have made contemporaneous comparisons of
   periphyton assemblages on artificial and natural substrata at one or a
   few sites, no broadly based comparison exists. We therefore surveyed the
   literature to establish conditions under which artificial substrata
   satisfactorily mimic both the quantity and the quality of natural
   periphyton assemblages. In general, epilithon was underestimated by the
   artificial substrata; epiphyton was overestimated, but less severely.
   These trends were significantly affected by the time available for
   colonization of the artificial substrata before sampling, site trophy,
   ambient temperature, and whether the study was conducted in a lake or in
   running water. Neither the composition of the substratum nor its
   orientation appeared important. Natural diatom assemblages were usually
   well simulated by those on artificial substrata, whereas both epilithic
   and epiphytic green and blue-green algae were severely underrepresented
   on the artificial substrata. Since artificial substrata often
   misrepresent both the quantity and the quality of natural periphyton,
   they should be used with more caution, especially in intersite and
   interseason surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Mass loss and microbial oxygen consumption on decaying leaves from five
   species of gallery forest trees were measured in six prairie streams
   (three perennial, three intermittent) ranging in size from 2nd to 4th
   order. Leaf decay was monitored for 56 d in late fall and early winter
   1987-1988. Mass loss was greatest for bois d'arc (Maclura pomifera),
   followed by hackberry (Celtis laevigata), cottonwood (Populus
   deltoides), elm (Ulmus rubra), and Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii).
   Breakdown rates in the six streams fell into two groups: decay in
   3rd-order intermittent, 3rd-order perennial, and 4th-order perennial
   streams all exhibited faster breakdown rates than the 2nd-order
   intermittent, 2nd-order perennial, and 4th-order intermittent streams.
   These differences appear to be related to stream order and hydrologic
   regime. Microbial respiration was strongly correlated with mass loss for
   the first 28 d. This period of rapid mass loss from the leaf litter was
   followed by a period in which mass loss and respiration were poorly
   correlated. Respiration was greatest on bois d'arc and hackberry,
   followed by cottonwood, elm, and oak. Microbial respiration accounted
   for 10\% to 66\% of the mass loss from the decaying leaves. Overall,
   leaf species seemed to be the most important factor controlling

Abstract = {{Periphyton succession was studied over 89 d in longitudinally adjacent
   reaches (a riffle and run) in Sycamore Creek, a spatially intermittent
   desert stream. Effects of nitrogen limitation were assessed by comparing
   algal development on clay saucers containing either nitrate-enriched or
   unenriched agar. We evaluated effects of grazing on periphyton accrual
   by amending agar in half the substrata from each enrichment condition
   with an insecticide (Malathion). Early successional (25-d) communities
   on unenriched substrata were dominated by Epithemia sorex, a diatom
   capable of N2 fixation; non-fixing diatoms dominated enriched
   communities. NO3-N enrichment increased algal diversity (H') and delayed
   late-successional dominance by Calothrix, a heterocystous
   cyanobacterium. Replacement of diatoms by cyanobacteria was likely
   facilitated by autogenic changes in nutrient and light conditions within
   the periphyton and temporal increases in water temperature.
   Three measures of algal biomass exhibited nearly linear increases in all
   treatments over the 3-mo study. Enrichment enhanced standing crops of
   chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) in both reaches, an effect
   most pronounced within the first 3-4 wk. Algal populations unable to fix
   N2 were stimulated by enrichment but remained in low abundance on
   unenriched substrata whereas biovolume of N2-fixing populations was
   lower on enriched substrata relative to controls.
   Malathion reduced the density of only one common grazer, the moth larva
   Petrophila jaliscalis, which was abundant only in the riffle. Addition
   of Malathion to enriched substrata in this habitat had no significant
   effect on net primary productivity or total algal biovolume but resulted
   in increased chlorophyll a and AFDM, suggesting that Petrophila did
   influence algal communities, but by a mechanism that remains unclear.
   Spatial heterogeneity of nutrient supply in this system contributes to
   maintenance of algal diversity; but over long successional series
   diversity declines regardless of enrichment owing to autogenic changes
   that occur during succession. Our results confirm earlier observations
   that low nitrogen availability limits accrual of algal biomass following
   spates and constrains algal community structure in Sycamore Creek.
   However, highly significant early successional differences in algal
   standing crop and community structure among enrichment treatments were
   eliminated or much reduced in mid to late stages of succession. We
   propose that this temporal change in enrichment response was caused by
   development of a thick periphyton mat that reduced availability of both
   water-column or substratum-derived nutrients to algae, and increased
   reliance on internal nutrient recycling.}},

   effect on benthic algae in streams. Patterns in orthophosphate (PO4-P),
   total phosphate (TP), nitrate (NO3-N), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN)
   concentrations in stream waters showed that nutrient concentrations
   could increase during and after spates. In-stream nutrient
   concentrations were correlated to indicators of spates in an
   agricultural basin more than in a forested catchment. Nutrient and
   current concentrations were manipulated in experimental stream channels
   to simulate a subscouring spate, i.e., a spate during which organisms
   are not removed from substrates. Increasing PO4-P and NO3-N
   concentrations in the water for 12 h had little immediate effect on
   algal biomass but did increase phosphorus concentrations in periphyton.
   This increase in periphyton-P did not stimulate algal growth. Doubling
   current from 10 to 20 cm/s for 24 h had no effect on benthic algal
   biomass during the 24-h manipulation. Increasing current increased
   periphyton-N in high nutrient conditions but decreased periphyton-N
   concentrations and algal growth rates in low nutrient conditions.
   Changes in periphyton chemistry provided valuable information for
   development of hypotheses to explain responses of algae to environmental

Abstract = {{Diel variations in drift of periphytic diatoms were studied in a small
   4th-order sandy stream and in enclosed recirculating water chambers in
   the laboratory to describe algal drift in the natural stream, identify
   algal species exhibiting diel periodicities in drift, determine if
   species-specific drift may be related to substrate selectivity, and
   determine if algal drift may be affected by benthic invertebrates.
   Stream water samples were collected at 2-h intervals for 24-h periods
   seven times from July 1986-July 1987. Algal drift ranged from 130-950
   cells/mL and was dominated by the periphytic diatoms Achnanthes
   minutissima, Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Achnanthes lanceolata
   var. dubia, Achnanthes clevei, Amphora perpusilla, Cocconeis diminuta,
   and Fragilaria brevistriata. A small centric diatom, Cyclotella
   comensis, was also common. Diel periodicities in algal drift were not
   observed.
   Three laboratory studies were conducted in triplicate to study drift of
   algae attached to macrophytic plants (14-17 September), rocks (21-24
   September), and sand (8-10 October). Photoperiod and temperature were
   adjusted to simulate conditions in the natural environment. Algal drift
   in chambers was collected at 2-h intervals. Two diatoms, A. minutissima
   and C. placentula var. euglypta exhibited diel periodicities in drift,
   but only in chambers containing macrophytic plants and rocks. No
   periodicities were apparent in chambers containing sand. Midday peaks in
   drift of both species averaged 6-15 times greater than minimum drift
   observed at night. After 2 d of normal photoperiod, we eliminated the
   next light period to monitor algal drift under 24 h constant darkness.
   Midday peaks in drift persisted indicating that diel periodicities in
   algal drift were not directly dependent on light availability. Algal
   drift was compared in chambers containing macrophytic plants with and
   without a common filter-feeding caddisfly, Brachycentrus americanus.
   Algal drift was not affected by B. americanus during the day; however,
   drift was greater in chambers with than without B. americanus at night.
   This was probably an effect of increased crawling and grazing activity
   and possible dislodgment of cells from substrates.
   Results of this study show that diel periodicities in algal drift are
   not readily evident in all small streams dominated by periphytic
   diatoms. Diel periodicities in algal drift are species-specific and
   under autogenic regulation which may be affected by light, substrate
   selectivity, and benthic invertebrates.}},

   Egg masses contained 150-800 eggs (mean 440.2, 95\% CL 75.6). Egg
   incubation period in the laboratory (y days) was related to temperature
   (x-degrees-C) by the equation ln(y) = 3.14 + 0.144 ln(x), taking 93 days
   at 6-degrees-C and 20 days at 18-degrees-C. Egg masses incubated in the
   field hatched as predicted by this equation. The length of individual
   eggs increased by an average of 17\% during incubation. Emergence from
   the egg took about 30 min, and newly hatched larvae had yolk in their
   guts which lasted 24-30 h, after which feeding began. Larvae took only
   live prey. In still water, larvae span silk, ventilated using abdominal
   undulations, turned in the net, and performed further miscellaneous
   movements. Newly hatched `yolky' larvae spent the most time spinning;
   older larvae resident in the mass of silk near the maternal egg mass
   carried out most ventilations and turns, and nonresident larvae made
   most other, miscellaneous movements. Interactions among siblings were
   categorised as `aggressive', `ignore' or `explore'. Interactions most
   commonly involved older residents, which were the only larvae to show
   aggression. Overall, most interactions were `ignore' and `explore'. In
   running water a large single net (up to 10 cm2), containing > 300
   larvae, was formed around one old egg mass. This colonial web persisted
   for at least 7 d and, although density declined rapidly, 3-4 larvae/cm2
   remained after 7 d. This pattern was repeated in three other egg masses
   kept in running water, net size reaching a peak approximately 3 d after
   the onset of egg hatching. Behaviour of individual larvae in running
   water was similar to that in still water, except that in flowing water
   they did not ventilate and turning behaviour was less frequent. During
   the first three days of life, residents in the net in flowing water
   ignored or explored each other without aggression. The first aggressive
   interactions were observed on day 4. It is proposed that the sharing of
   silk is the main selective value of this briefly colonial system. Silk
   provides shelter and probably increases the likelihood of obtaining the
   first meal.}},

   temperatures on life history, population dynamics, and secondary
   production of the freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca (Saussure) in
   three Typha stands of a eutrophic, subtropical lake. Our results were
   compared with those from temperate habitats. Mean egg development period
   of laboratory females (11 d) was 2-4 d longer than for temperate
   populations but mean fecundity (laboratory = 3.91; field = 2.48) was
   comparable. Birth rates of field females were low (0.01-0.06 per
   capita/d and 0.07-0.25 per mature female/d) with lowest rates during the
   summer when water temperatures were 25-34-degrees-C. Annual mean
   density, mean standing stock, and annual production estimates from Lake
   Thonotosassa (12,354/m2, 2.46 g/m2, and 26.9 g m-2 yr-1) were markedly
   higher than those seen in temperate studies. However, among-site
   variation in Lake Thonotosassa was large. Our annual production: biomass
   ratio (P/BBAR) was 10.9 and exceeded that of temperate populations, but
   cohort P/BBAR was 3.9 and comparable. The Lake Thonotosassa population
   of H. azteca was multivoltine with a cohort CPI of 129 d whereas
   temperate populations usually are univoltine with CPI intervals > 365 d.
   Subtropical temperature regimens, continuous reproduction and
   recruitment of amphipods, and year-around abundance of Typha and
   associated epiphytic algal communities appear to be the factors
   responsible for high densities and production in this subtropical lake.}},

Abstract = {{Resh et al. (1988, J. N. Am. Benthol. Soc. 7:433) assert that lotic
   ecosystems are unique in that disturbances are necessarily
   ``unpredictable{''} events.  Acceptance of the ``predictability
   clause{''} in the definition of disturbance introduces problems that
   influence our ability to identify, describe, and discuss important
   aspects of disturbance in streams.  I focus on four specific aspects of
   Resh et al.'s treatment of predictability, particularly as it relates to
   hydrologic disturbance (e.g., spates). First, Resh et al. offer only
   purely statistical criteria for identifying hydrologic disturbance, an
   approach that has important limitations for characterizing
   predictability of the disturbance regime. I suggest adoption of more
   physically based measures of disturbance (e.g., flow at which movement
   of bed is initiated) to which specific ecological responses can be
   determined. Second, lotic species are assumed to be ``adapted{''} to
   predictable hydrological events, despite the general absence of
   supporting empirical evidence. I suggest that this assertion be reframed
   as a testable hypothesis. Third, defining disturbances as necessarily
   unpredictable can result in a tautology, in which biological response to
   disturbance and predictability of disturbance are expressed in terms of
   one another. Fourth, a more explicit distinction between ecological and
   evolutionary time scales of response to disturbance allows
   predictability to be properly considered as a separate (and
   non-tautological) component of the disturbance regime. In sum,
   disturbances (including predictable ones) always have ecological
   effects; however, the magnitude of ecological response to a particular
   disturbance may be constrained by evolutionary (historical) adjustments
   of the biota if the disturbance regime is characterized by high
   predictability.}},

Abstract = {{The ecotone concept is used to consider exchanges of matter and energy
   between groundwater and surface water systems. Ecotones control these
   exchanges by acting as a combination of three types of filter: the
   contrast between permanent darkness and day-night alternation produces a
   photic filter; the matrix of interstitial underground systems creates a
   mechanical filter which slow, down water velocity; biological and
   chemical processes, which often occur simultaneously, define a
   biochemical filter. The permeability of these filters changes according
   to water velocity. Thus, for ecotones between a surface system and a
   porous aquifer with large substrate pore size, dynamics of permeability
   are governed by hydrology, whereas between a surface system and a
   partially clogged aquifer with small substrate pore size, they are
   governed by aerobic and anaerobic processes. According to the degree of
   permeability, ecotones can be classified as either permanent or
   temporary sinks for the two adjacent systems. In the latter case, matter
   fluxes are retained in the ecotone, often undergoing transformation
   before being released to one of the ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Stream biotopes (habitat types) have commonly been defined using
   subjective recognition of hydraulic and substrate conditions. In this
   study the relationship between groups of macroinvertebrates and
   subjectively defined biotopes was examined at three sites in the upper,
   middle, and lower reaches of the Buffalo River. Biotopes which were
   recognised included riffles, leaf packs in riffles, and a waterfall
   (erosional biotopes); and stony backwaters, marginal vegetation and
   sediments (depositional biotopes). Over 100 taxa were identified from
   the three sites, and an hierarchical classification of 138 samples was
   prepared using TWINSPAN. The first division distinguished between the
   invertebrate assemblages of the upper reaches and those of the
   middle/lower reaches. In the upper reaches, the waterfall was
   differentiated from all the other stream biotopes. In addition, seasonal
   changes in assemblage composition were recognised. Divisions in the
   middle/lower reaches differentiated between biotopes. Of the 27 most
   common taxa, 13 occurred in a single biotope in more than 50\% of the
   samples in which they had been collected. Clearest species-biotope
   associations were riffle-dwelling mayflies and caddisflies, and
   stone-dwelling planaria and ancylid gastropods. Invertebrate assemblages
   were not always associated with subjectively identified biotopes,
   particularly in the narrow headwaters, where different biotopes tended
   to be smaller and less distinct. However, associations of assemblages
   with biotopes were found in the middle/lower reaches. This study shows
   that stratified random sampling regimes can be useful tools in stream
   research if the scale at which biotopes are recognised is clearly
   defined.}},

   2-4 wk intervals in 1982 to investigate life history characteristics,
   and at monthly intervals in 1983 to determine consistency of seasonal
   and annual abundance patterns.  Baetidae and Heptageniidae were abundant
   throughout each year with average densities of 1553-5981/m2 (1982-1983)
   and 1498-1828/m2 of snag surface, respectively.  Field data for the most
   common species of Baetidae (Baetis ephippiatus, B. intercalaris) and
   Heptageniidae (Stenonema exiguum, S. integrum, S. modestum) showed no
   recognizable pattern of cohort development.  This developmental
   asynchrony and long emergence periods for S. exiguum and S. modestum are
   consistent with previously published growth studies indicating
   multivoltinism.  Ephemerellidae (551-719/m2), Oligoneuriidae
   (206-469/m2), Tricorythidae (721-1599/m2) and Caenidae (114-110/m2) were
   also commonly found on snags, but were seasonal in abundance.  The major
   species of Ephemerellidae (Ephemerella argo, E. dorothea, Eurylophella
   sp.) showed distinct single cohorts developing primarily during
   winter/spring.  Isonychia spp. (Oligoneuriidae) also showed a
   well-defined winter cohort, but had as many as two weakly defined

   sp. (Tricorythidae) occurred primarily in summer months, during which
   time they were able to pass through multiple generations, as
   substantiated by either long emergence periods or independent growth
   studies.  Major differences in life histories occurred between rather
   than within families.  Relative abundance and seasonality at the family

   importance of relationships between biomass of black flies and
   microhabitat features (depth, current velocity, rock size), site
   properties (distance from the lake, seston quality), and biomass of
   Hydropsychidae.  Microhabitat features and site properties accounted for
   14-47\% of the variability in biomass of hydropsychids and simuliids on
   individual rocks, and between 30 and 67\% of variability in mean biomass
   across sites.  Addition of biomass of potential competitors did not
   significantly improve the proportion of variability accounted for by the
   multiple regression models.  Within most sampling sites, biomasses of
   simuliids and of hydropsychids were positively correlated.  However,
   analysis of microdistribution patterns across sites suggests a small but
   significant negative partial correlation between hydropsychids and
   simuliids in summer and a positive partial correlation in winter. 
   Analysis of covariance revealed strong site effects that could not be
   explained by microhabitat features or biomass of potential competitors. 
   These results suggest that hydropsychids have a negative effect on
   biomass of simuliids in summer, but that biomass of simuliids in
   different sites is more influenced by microhabitat features and site
   properties than by the biomass of hydropsychids.  Reanalysis of
   published work on interactions between simuliids and caddisflies
   suggests that intensity of competition is relatively constant, but that
   its importance is overestimated by controlled experiments.  Quantitative
   models describing the distribution of filter feeders across sites should
   include better correlates of site suitability rather than considering
   abundance of competing groups.}},

   positive relationships with the dry weight of P. guttifer and N. fuscus,
   respectively. This suggests that grazing may remove older or overstory
   algae and thereby prevent senescence of the algal assemblage. Both
   active larvae and diapausing prepupae of N. fuscus were affected
   strongly by densities of conspecifics, exhibiting increases in weight
   only in treatments at 33\% of natural density; this suggests a release
   from intraspecific competition. Survivorship of N. fuscus larvae and
   prepupae was not dependent on intraspecific density, but mean
   survivorship tended to decline with increasing density of conspecifics.
   Intraspecific competition may increase the variation in the biomass of
   individual N. fuscus larvae; at high densities, there may be individual
   ``winners{''} and ``losers{''} of aggregate biomass. No significant
   effects of intraspecific competition were detected for larvae of P.
   guttifer, and a significant interspecific effect of N. fuscus density on
   the biomass of individual P. guttifer did not have a consistent effect
   with changes in density.}},

Abstract = {{Epilithon patch structure was investigated in a 4th-order boreal river
   in northern New York State, USA.  Benthic and suspended sampling units,
   consisting of 120-cm long strands of 5-mm glass beads oriented parallel
   to the current, were placed in a fast-flowing riffle and an adjacent
   slow-flowing peripheral channel 2 mo prior to sampling.  During three
   sampling periods, spring, summer, and autumn, 42 units were collected. 
   The substratum contour beneath each benthic sampling unit was mapped,
   and epilithon patch development was examined at 1 cm resolution by
   assaying bead pairs for either chlorophyll or alkaline phosphatase
   activity.
   Epilithon patch length, estimated by spatial autocorrelation analysis,
   was 10 +/- 8 (SD) cm, approximately half that of the cobble and boulder
   substratum (22 +/- 9 cm), with no apparent differences between sites or
   seasons.  The magnitude of between-patch variation (patch amplitude),
   quantified by analysis of semivariance, did show spatial and temporal
   patterns that were dependent on the parameter measured.  Between-patch
   variation in alkaline phosphatase activity was consistently higher at
   the fast site, with an average amplitude of about 24-mu-mol h-1 cm-2 vs.
   12 for the slow site.  Chlorophyll data showed a seasonal pattern with
   the highest between-patch variation occurring during the summer.  The
   average fractal dimension of the epilithon (D = 1.81) was much greater
   than that of the substratum (D = 1.25), suggesting that epilithon patch
   structure emerged primarily from small scale processes such as
   turbulence and macroinvertebrate activity.  The complexity of the patch
   structure has implications for food web organization, patch stability,
   and nutrient spiralling.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of ambient levels of snail grazing on rates and direction of
   benthic algal succession were investigated in experimental chambers
   located near two lakes.  Benthic algal environments were manipulated by
   introducing snails (15 individuals/m2) to flow-through experimental
   systems (for 26-28 d) where clay tiles were colonized with algae from
   littoral lake water from Douglas Lake, Michigan, and Kentucky Lake,
   Kentucky.
   We found that algal succession was not always evident in ungrazed
   conditions; but when successional changes were evident, many different
   growth forms were observed among early and late succession species. 
   Early succession species were typically non-motile unicellular or
   colonial growth forms, whereas late succession species were motile
   unicellular or filamentous diatoms and cyanobacteria.  Grazing by the
   snail Elimia livescens arrested succession of non-diatom algae by
   selectively removing the overstory of filamentous cyanobacteria. 
   However, grazing by E. livescens enhanced succession among diatoms by
   selectively grazing the early succession diatoms and leaving small
   motile late succession species.  Whether grazing enhanced or arrested
   succession, or changed the direction of succession, was dependent upon
   growth forms of early and late succession algal species, which varied
   among habitats and corresponding species assemblages.}},

   G. lobiferus (30.0\%).  Various fungal parasites and other factors
   accounted for overall rates of egg mass infection and egg mortality of
   55.6\% and 15.3\%, respectively.  Highest levels of parasitism were
   recorded in egg masses of G. lobiferus (81.1\% infection in egg masses,
   29.9\% mortality in eggs) whereas low levels of parasitism occurred in

Abstract = {{Using the spiralling concept, this study assessed the relative
   importance of temperature, current velocity, leaf biomass, fine
   particulate organic matter, and leaf type in determining phosphorus
   retention in woodland streams.  To accomplish this objective, streamside
   artificial streams and two contrasting leaf types were used.  A labile
   leaf type (dogwood), typical of successional forest vegetation, and a
   more refractory leaf type (oak) characteristic of mature forest species
   were chosen.  Leaves were picked just before abscission and air dried. 
   Dogwood leaves were added to three streams and oak leaves to three other
   streams.  Phosphorus uptake experiments were conducted in the streams
   during November 1987-June 1988 and November 1988-June 1989.  All streams
   were least retentive of phosphorus in December, the coldest month of the
   year, and more retentive in the warmer spring and summer months. 
   Phosphorus uptake was not correlated with microbial biomass or activity
   on leaves or with leaf biomass.  However, streams with oak leaves were
   more retentive than streams with dogwood leaves.  Measurements of
   penetrance (i.e., weight required to push a metal rod through the leaf)
   revealed that dogwood leaves were softer than oak leaves.  The soft
   dogwood leaves were less effective at retarding water flow and therefore
   velocity was typically faster in dogwood streams (p < 0.05; Pearson's
   correlation).  This higher velocity apparently contributed to lower
   retention.  These results suggest that phosphorus retention under
   conditions of this experiment was governed primarily by temperature and
   water velocity.  Coarse and fine particulate organic matter biomass and
   composition did influence retention, but their impact was secondary to
   the effects of temperature and velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the ubiquitous presence of microscopic herbivores such as
   protozoa in aquatic ecosystems, research on benthic herbivory has
   largely focused on the role of macroscopic grazers.  The present study
   shows the potential for protozoan herbivores to affect the structure of
   benthic algal assemblages through selective grazing.  The abundance and
   feeding preferences of three common algivorous protozoans, the ciliates
   Chilodonella sp. and Trithigmostoma cucullulus and the sarcodine
   Pelomyxa sp., were determined in a productive, third-order stream and in
   stream-side channels which contained different densities of two
   macrograzers and algal assemblages with different physiognomies and
   species composition.  Although the species composition of the ingested
   algal contents of individual micrograzer cells varied, all three
   micrograzer populations exhibited selectivity in their feeding on
   dominant diatom species.  Selectivity varied among microherbivore
   species and with the abundance of indigenous macrograzers.  Although the
   smallest of the three microherbivores (Chilodonella) appeared to be
   limited to grazing smaller diatom species, selectivity by the two larger
   species was not strongly related to size or growth form of diatom prey. 
   Selective feeding was still prevalent when the three microherbivore
   species were considered together as a guild, indicating the potential
   for an impact on diatom assemblage structure.  Although initial
   predictions of grazing rates of herbivorous protozoa on benthic diatoms
   suggest that such impacts can be substantial, more detailed studies of
   protozoan production potentials and microherbivore-algal interactions
   will be required to confirm or reject these preliminary estimates.}},

Abstract = {{A 54-d experiment was conducted in laboratory streams to examine
   relationships between temporal and spatial patterns of algal development
   and grazing behavior of the snail Juga silicula in a patchy physical
   environment.  Each stream contained nine channel-spanning blocks (22.5 x
   22.5 x 4 cm) spaced 22.5 cm apart and was illuminated with a photon flux
   density of 375, 90 or 20-mu-E m-2 s-2.  We monitored periphyton
   succession and the number of snails in fast current regimes on tops of
   blocks (exposed substrata) and in slower current regimes on surfaces
   recessed between blocks (sheltered substrata).
   At the end of the experiment, algal biomass in streams illuminated with
   high irradiance was approximately 80x and 8x greater than in streams
   with low and intermediate irradiance, respectively.  Growth rates of
   Juga in streams with high and intermediate irradiances were similar and
   approximately 15x greater than rates at low irradiance.  At all
   irradiances, snail densities were higher and algal biomass was lower on
   sheltered substrata than on exposed substrata.  As algal biomass became
   low on sheltered substrata, snails tended to be more abundant on exposed
   substrata, and biomass values in the two current regimes became more
   similar.  Differences in algal biomass and snail abundance between the
   two substrata were greater in streams illuminated with high irradiance
   than for the two lower irradiances.  Algal assemblages with low
   irradiance contained adnate cell forms early in succession.  At
   intermediate irradiance, succession in both current regimes moved
   towards adnate cells, but this occurred more rapidly on the more heavily
   grazed sheltered substrata.  At high irradiance, parts of the algal
   assemblages in both current regimes remained ungrazed, producing a mix
   of successional stages on the substrata.  Similar interactions may occur
   in coastal Oregon (USA) streams, because Juga is the competitive
   dominant herbivore with few predators, and its distribution corresponds
   mainly to irradiance (as one of the major determinants of algal
   abundance), current regime, and substratum size.}},

Abstract = {{At natural densities in enclosures in an eastern Tennessee headwater
   stream, snails (Elimia clavaeformis) and juvenile creek chubs (Semotilus

   reduced the total number of invertebrates without affecting total
   invertebrate biomass.  Conversely, creek chubs reduced the total
   biomass, but not the total number of invertebrates.  No interaction was
   detected between snail and fish effects on either total invertebrate
   biomass or abundance.  Both taxa appeared to affect the benthos by
   direct and indirect trophic pathways.  Elimia reduced the abundance of
   non-tanypodine chironomids, apparently by interference.  Elimia also
   appeared to reduce the abundances of some predators of benthic insects
   (salamanders {[}Desmognathus fuscus], dragonfly nymphs {[}Lanthus sp.],

   Multiple regression analyses indicated that snail and fish mass were

   predator with the greatest potential impact on Epitheca population
   densities.  Redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) consumed large numbers
   of Epitheca during mid-July, and the dragonflies consumed were larger
   than expected based on size-distributions found in the lake.  In fact,
   those eaten were often from sizes identified as potentially following
   univoltine development, suggesting that predation from large fish could
   reduce the success of the univoltine strategy.
   We also conducted an experiment in small (0.15 m2) in situ enclosures to
   examine competition between small sunfish and Epitheca.  We found that
   while small sunfish had little influence on larval survival, larvae grew
   more slowly in their presence than in their absence.  Thus small sunfish
   potentially hindered the ability of larvae to develop in a univoltine
   manner.
   Lastly, we conducted an experiment in large (24 m2) enclosures to test
   hypotheses generated by the studies above.  Small sunfish produced a
   statistically significant reduction in the ratio of univoltine to
   semivoltine Epitheca larvae; and both large and small fish decreased the
   number of successfully emerging univoltine Epitheca.
   These studies show that in the absence of potentially deleterious biotic
   interactions, most Epitheca larvae in Bays Mountain Lake follow
   univoltine development; but competition and predation from sunfish
   result in lowered success of the univoltine strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence and microdistribution of microcrustaceans in nine low

   sediments with a sand matrix, but occurred in all benthic habitats. 
   Cladocerans included the Daphnidae, Macrothricidae, Bosminidae, and

   structure differed significantly among streams, but these differences
   were not correlated with total invertebrate biomass or periphyton
   abundance.  Normalized biomass spectra in all streams were peaked,
   unlike those reported for marine and freshwater benthic and planktonic
   communities.  It is likely, however, that addition of bacterial, algal,
   and meiofaunal components to obtain spectra for the entire epilithic
   community may linearize the spectra, yielding approximately equal
   biomasses in logarithmic size classes.  When combined with allometric

   (Plecoptera:  Malenka cornuta, Despaxia augusta, and Eucapnosis
   brevicauda) that differed in type of life cycle, maximum size, and
   timing of emergence.  Body size was inversely related to temperature for
   three species (r = 0.40 to -0.71) but not for the other three (r = -0.09
   to -0.24).  Those species showing a relationship between size and

   temperature.  The other species emerged either during late spring
   following a period of relatively constant temperature or during the
   period of declining temperature in autumn.  Color and meristic variation
   showed no pattern of association with temperature across species.  A
   development rate model of temperature-dependent growth appears to

   broadly overlap alpha diversities found in temperate streams.  There was
   no significant correlation between insect diversity and altitude in the
   Panamanian streams.  Similarity of Ephemeroptera faunas among streams
   showed two patterns:  a relatively homogeneous mountain stream fauna in
   localities above 300 m elevation, and a much more heterogeneous fauna in
   lowland streams below this altitude.  These patterns were less clear for

Abstract = {{Aquatic macrophytes have been viewed as important to invertebrates as
   substrates for periphyton and epiphytic food, refuges from predation,
   heterogeneous substrates for co-existence, and upon senescence and death
   as detrital food sources.  Direct herbivory on living macrophytes has
   been considered unimportant and has been understudied until recently.  A
   review of the literature shows that, when looked for, invertebrate
   herbivory of macrophytes is more common than generally thought.  Most
   herbivory on macrophytes is usually by specialized oligophagous
   herbivores which are placed phylogenetically in families and orders of
   primarily terrestrial insect groups (secondary invaders) that include a
   number of pest herbivores in terrestrial systems (e.g., chrysomelid and
   curculionid beetles, aquatic lepidopterans, and specialized dipterans). 
   Herbivores from primarily aquatic invertebrate groups (primary aquatic
   invertebrates) are often generalists and also detritivores.  These
   patterns and the use of macrophyte detritus by primary aquatic
   invertebrates do not appear to be determined by a low food quality of
   aquatic macrophytes, but are more likely related to deterrent chemicals
   present in both terrestrial and aquatic plants.  In order to more
   clearly ascertain the importance of aquatic macrophytes as food and
   their interrelations with aquatic invertebrates, more mechanistic
   studies are needed of aquatic herbivores, herbivore damage to plants,
   and the secondary chemistry of aquatic plants.}},

Abstract = {{Transport and retention of particulate organic matter (POM) were
   examined in the channels and on the floodplains of two low-gradient
   headwater streams on the Coastal Plain of southeastern Virginia.  During
   base discharge, POM was primarily retained as it settled onto the
   sediment surface, but during high discharge, debris dams became primary
   retainers.  During overbank flooding much of the coarse particulate
   organic matter (CPOM) moved from the channels onto the floodplains.  The
   mean distance that wood moved over a year at Colliers Creek, which had
   low current velocity and a broad, frequently inundated floodplain, was
   23 m in the channel and 46 m on the floodplain; at Buzzards Branch, with
   higher current velocity and a smaller, less-frequently inundated
   floodplain, wood moved a mean distance of 136 m in the channel and only
   2 m on the floodplain.  Mean leaf transport distances in the channels
   ranged from 1.6 m in Colliers Creek during summer base discharge to 156
   m at Buzzards Branch during a winter spate; mean leaf transport
   distances on the floodplains were 0.5-1.7 m.  Fine particulate organic
   matter (FPOM) transport, studied only during base discharge, was farther
   than that of wood or leaves and varied from 1.8 m during summer base
   discharge in the Colliers Creek channel to 84.0 m during winter base
   discharge in the Buzzards Branch channel.  Over one year, 97\% and 27\%
   of the marked wood placed in the channels was transported into the
   Colliers Creek and Buzzards Branch floodplains, respectively; only 4-9\%
   of the marked wood placed in the floodplains moved into the channels. 
   Base flow flux of POM was 24,000 kg/yr and 1700 kg/yr on the
   floodplains, and 7000 kg/yr and 13,000 kg/yr in the channels, at
   Colliers Creek and Buzzards Branch, respectively.  Retention, transport
   distance, and magnitude of POM exchange between the channels and
   floodplains were dependent on the timing, frequency and extent of
   spates, and floodplain inundation, which thus were critical determinants
   of POM dynamics and hence system structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of nutrient input and grazing intensity on
   resistance and resilience of periphyton communities in laboratory
   streams to a scour disturbance.  Previous theoretical studies using
   stream models indicated that resilience of nutrient-limited streams, as
   defined by the return time to the initial state, is strongly related to
   the residence time of nutrients in the system and to the presence of
   herbivores.  To experimentally test this prediction we established two
   levels of nutrient input by altering the flow regime (once-through flow
   and 98\% recirculated flow) and two levels of grazing intensity by the
   presence or absence of the snail Elimia clavaeformis, resulting in a 2 x
   2 factorial design with two replicate streams per treatment.  After the
   streams reached an approximately stable level of periphyton biomass, a
   scour disturbance was imposed on all streams.  Measures of the
   resistance and resilience of the periphyton to this disturbance were
   made.
   The resistance of most structural characteristics of the periphyton was
   significantly higher in streams with snails than in streams without
   snails.  Nutrient input had little effect on resistance of all
   periphyton characteristics.  Resilience was measured by two parameters: 
   rate of increase of a particular characteristic over time following the
   disturbance (r), and time to return to the predisturbance state (T(s)). 
   The experimental results on resilience were complex.  In general, high
   grazing intensity resulted in low values of r for most periphyton
   characteristics, but also shorter T(s) for some characteristics.  The
   shorter T(s) values were attributed to lower pre-disturbance biomass and
   metabolism in the streams with snails compensating for lower r for these
   characteristics following the disturbance.  Contrary to model
   predictions, low nutrient input generally did not result in low
   resilience for most characteristics in the streams without snails,
   probably because increased nutrient recycling compensated for low
   inputs.  However, for the streams with snails, resilience of most
   periphyton characteristics was lower in streams with low nutrient input
   compared with streams with higher nutrient input.  This contrast in
   resilience suggests a positive feedback between biomass accrual and
   nutrient recycling that helps maintain high productivity despite low
   nutrient inputs during recovery of stream periphyton communities from
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Natural occurrence of overturned stones and the distribution of moss
   with respect to stone size and stability were examined in two North
   Swedish woodland streams.  In total, 16.7\% of moss-covered stones had
   obviously been overturned in the last few years.  Moss was rare on small
   stones except for those that were embedded in the surrounding substrate.
   On large stones (> 12 cm), moss was abundant and embedment did not
   affect the moss distribution here.  It is concluded that the stability
   of substrates markedly affected the distribution of stream moss.  In a
   field experiment, moss-covered stones were overturned to simulate mild
   spate effects, and the recovery of moss and invertebrates was followed
   for 14 mo.  The treatment reduced ash free dry weight of moss as well as
   diversity (H') and total abundance of invertebrates.  Three out of 16
   invertebrate taxa increased their density as a result of disturbance,
   showing peak densities on the moss-covered underside of overturned
   stones.  All other taxa decreased their density upon overturning, and in
   these taxa peak densities were found on the moss-covered upper side of
   control stones.  Recovery of moss and invertebrates was still weak 14 mo
   after the stone overturning.  I conclude that overturning of stones has
   severe and prolonged effects on stream moss and, indirectly, on the
   benthic invertebrate community.}},

Abstract = {{Growth rates were measured for chironomid larvae throughout the year in

   Growth rates were among the highest ever reported for chironomids in

   Chironomini, Tanytarsini, and Orthocladiinae, respectively.  The
   relationship of growth with temperature was best described with
   second-order polynomial curves for Chironomini, Tanytarsini, and total
   Chironomidae.  Most curves suggest an x-axis intercept (zero growth) at
   4-7-degrees-C and a growth maximum at 21-24-degrees-C.  Growth rates
   were significantly lower and the relationship of growth with temperature
   was no longer significant when river discharge was well below the mean. 
   Growth equations were applied to natural environmental conditions,
   predicting maximum growth during spring and fall, with an annual growth
   rate (an approximation of annual P/B ratio) ranging from 222 for
   Chironomini to 182 for Tanytarsini.  Predicted growth rates high

   can be assumed based on their standing stock biomass alone.}},

Abstract = {{Dromogomphus spinosus (Odonata:  Gomphidae) larvae are ``burrowing{''}
   dragonflies which usually inhabit sand deposits in lotic systems.  This
   species has recently invaded Bays Mountain Lake (Sullivan Country,
   Tennessee, USA), where larvae now occupy widespread submersed macrophyte
   and allochthonous detritus habitats.  It is now one of the more abundant
   species in a relatively stable odonate assemblage.  During the
   Dromogomphus invasion, there was a gradual decline in abundance of
   Epitheca (Tetragoneuria) cynosura (Odonata:  Corduliidae), the dominant
   anisopteran in that assemblage.  Analyses of Dromogomphus and Epitheca
   numbers from 12 years (1977-1989) of monthly sweep-net samples at fixed
   stations within each of five types of littoral zone habitat document
   trends in population size, suggest that both species have partially
   semivoltine life-histories with comparable phenology, and show overlap
   in habitat use between species as well as negative correlations of
   within-sample abundances for some habitats.
   Gut contents of Dromogomphus collected in these sweep-net samples showed
   no change in diet over the 12-yr period.  Predominant prey were midge
   larvae (56\%), especially ``burrowing{''} midges, and oligochaetes
   (34\%).  Analyses of fecal pellets produced by specimens of both
   Dromogomphus and Epitheca collected during 1988-1989 show that diets
   differed for both ``small{''} and ``large{''} instars.  For both size
   categories, Epitheca tended to eat more microcrustaceans, but small
   larvae also ate more ``miscellaneous arthropods{''} (including odonate
   larvae).
   Comparing 1988-1989 Epitheca diets with those reported previously from
   1978-1979 suggests that large Epitheca exhibited a dietary niche shift
   during the Dromogomphus invasion.  Contemporary large Epitheca eat fewer
   ``burrowing{''} midges and more oligochaetes and microcrustaceans than
   they did previously.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain midges (Diptera:  Deuterophlebiidae) are widespread and
   seasonally abundant in streams of western North America.  As part of a
   comprehensive systematic investigation of the Deuterophlebiidae, I
   examined the life histories of all Nearctic species, including aspects
   of habitat, reproductive biology, and phenology.  Collection techniques
   were also evaluated.  This paper is based on qualitative data obtained
   during a seven-year period (1981-1988) and from more than 500 collection
   sites, and on a quantitative phenological study in 1986 of 17
   populations from the Pacific Northwest.
   Deuterophlebiids generally are considered stenobionts, requiring cold,
   mountain streams; however, many species inhabit a diversity of stream
   types, from small, high-gradient creeks to large, low-gradient rivers. 
   The immature stages of all species are restricted to riffle habitats
   where current velocities typically exceed 1 m/s.  Adult mountain midges
   exhibit marked diel synchrony, with emergence, flight, and mating during
   only the early morning.  Flight behaviour of the short-lived adults is
   distinct and includes formation of male swarms.  Field and laboratory
   observations show that females shed their wings and select oviposition
   sites underwater.  Asynchronous life histories are typical of Nearctic
   species, with egg-hatching and adult emergence usually extending 2-3 mo.
   This strategy is adaptive for populations in the Pacific Northwest,
   where unpredictable spring spates may scour substrates and cause
   correspondingly high mortality of stream benthos.  Univoltine life
   histories are typical of Nearctic mountain midges, though variation from
   this pattern was seen in three populations.  Temporal, habitat and/or
   reproductive isolation of sympatric deuterophlebiids, blepharicerids,
   and other torrenticolous insects was evident in many streams.}},

Abstract = {{Diel periodicities of mate attraction and flight activity were examined
   for three caddisfly species (Insecta:  Trichoptera) that use female sex
   pheromones to attract conspecific males:  Dicosmoecus gilvipes (Hagen)
   (Limnephilidae), Gumaga nigricula (McL.) (Sericostomatidae), and Gumaga
   griseola (McL.).  Live females of D. gilvipes attracted males during the
   night, with 58\% of the males being captured in the first hour after
   sunset.  Live females of G. griseola attracted 97\% of the males during
   the hour before sunrise whereas live females of G. nigricula attracted
   85\% of the males 2-4 h after sunrise.  For all three species, the
   periodicity of male response to female pheromone was the same as the
   periodicity of male response to live females.  In laboratory chambers,
   male and female D. gilvipes flew during the mate attraction period but
   generally not at other times.  Male flight for G. nigricula and G.
   griseola was generally most intense during periods of mate attraction,
   and was reduced during non-attraction periods.  In contrast, females of
   both Gumaga species were relatively sedentary during periods of mate
   attraction.  The presence of circadian rhythms that govern the
   periodicity of flight was demonstrated for all taxa and sexes except
   females of D. gilvipes.  Light intensity and air temperature influenced
   the amount of flight activity but not flight periodicity.  The
   temporally brief and coordinated activities of these short-lived adults
   may serve to conserve metabolic resources, contribute to their
   reproductive success, and maintain reproductive isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic ecologists have recently begun to use animal body size as an
   alternative or supplement to traditional taxonomic descriptions of
   benthic communities, probably because of the successful use of a
   body-size based approach by planktonic ecologists.  Relatively little
   information is available on the size structure of benthic animal
   communities, factors that affect the size structure of zoobenthic
   communities, or consequences of the size structure of a zoobenthic
   community.  Marine and lacustrine zoobenthic communities have different
   size structures, and there are conspicuous differences among lakes in
   zoobenthic size structure.  Factors likely to influence the size
   structure of lacustrine zoobenthos include water chemistry, lake
   productivity, and vertebrate predation.  I conclude, however, that the
   effects of vertebrate predation on zoobenthic size structure probably
   are weaker than on zooplankton owing to the availability of physical
   refuges to the zoobenthos and to the widespread occurrence of
   morphological and behavioral defenses against vertebrate predation among
   zoobenthos.  In turn, the size structure of zoobenthos may affect growth
   rates and productivity of fish, the fate of zoobenthic production, the
   turnover rate (and similar ecophysiological properties) of zoobenthos,
   food web efficiencies, and rates of sediment mixing.  There are thus
   many opportunities for zoobenthic ecologists to use a size-based
   perspective in their research.  Nevertheless, benthic ecologists should
   not apply planktonic paradigms about body size relationships
   uncritically to benthic communities, for body size has different
   implications for zoobenthos than for zooplankton.}},

Abstract = {{The autotrophic and heterotrophic nature of attached algal and bacterial
   populations in streams was investigated in July and August 1986.  Glass
   slides were colonized in two rivers in Algonquin Park, Ontario, that
   differed in their concentration of bioavailable phosphorus (P).  The
   importance of three abundant algal species was demonstrated by
   considering their activities on a cellular level using nuclear track
   autoradiography (NTA).  Community biomass accrual, carbon fixation, and
   phosphate uptake were monitored at bi-weekly intervals and were
   generally reflective of that of the dominant algal species in each
   river.  It has been proposed that, in running waters, nutrients do not
   cycle in place but are continually translocated downstream before being
   re-used by attached organisms.  This mode of recycling was demonstrated
   by monitoring biotic incorporation, release, and subsequent downstream
   re-incorporation of radiolabelled P and carbon (C) metabolites at the
   community and cellular levels.  The river with less bioavailable P
   re-assimilated the P metabolites more quickly, but C re-assimilation was
   similar in the two rivers.  This may account for observations that
   biomass development in running waters may exceed that predicted from
   empirical P-biomass relationships.
   Data presented also provide evidence that the species succession, and
   consequently the tiered development of a biofilm, was the result of the
   differing abilities of species to sequester and recycle organic and
   inorganic nutrients from overlying waters.}},

Year = {{1991}},

Abstract = {{To test the roles of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) loading
   and fish predation on benthic community structure and leafpack
   breakdown, CPOM and fish density were manipulated in a stream.  Mt.
   Sinai Creek, a 3rd-order stream in Piedmont North Carolina, USA, was
   divided into twelve 30-m2 segments with 0.5-m high weirs.  CPOM was
   loaded and maintained at 0.01 ambient, ambient and 4 x ambient levels
   for 19 mo.  Fish were excluded from half the segments and maintained at
   natural densities in the others, in a fully cross-classified design.
   Neither CPOM loading nor fish predation had significant effects on
   leafpack breakdown and macrobenthic species richness or diversity in
   leafpack and sediment samples on all dates.  The total abundance of
   invertebrates was reduced by fish in sediment samples but not in
   leafpacks.  Almost all species were not significantly affected by the
   CPOM or fish treatments.  Only two taxa responded to each treatment in
   sediments throughout the study, and none responded in leafpacks, i.e.,
   less than 5\% of the taxa tested.  Interactions between fish and CPOM
   were rarely significant.
   This work shows that CPOM loading and fish predation, and their
   interactions, were not major forces in determining the diversity,
   richness, or litter breakdown rates of this lotic community.  The
   absence of a fish effect on the animals in leafpacks suggests that
   leafpacks function as a refuge from fish predation for macrobenthic
   invertebrates.  The effect of fish predation on total individuals but
   not on populations in sediments suggests that fish feeding has a
   significant impact on the benthos, but that natural variability in
   population sizes can obscure this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in growth rates, maximum nymphal sizes, densities, and
   production estimates of Ephoron leukon (Ephemeroptera: Polymitarcyidae)
   were investigated at two sites over a 3-yr period on the South River,
   Virginia.  Ephoron leukon is univoltine with development confined to a
   short (3-4 mo) period during the summer followed by a long (8-9 mo) egg
   diapause.  The short growing season combined with a high degree of
   developmental syncrony makes this species ideal for comparative fields
   studies.
   Relative growth rates ranged from 0.014 to 0.028 mg/mg/day and
   significant differences were observed between sites and years.  Spatial
   differences in growth rates were explained by between-site differences
   in thermal regime but between-year differences were not.  Differences in
   average densities between years may have been important in explaining
   annual differences in growth rates.
   Maximum nymphal weights averaged between 3.22 and 4.78 mg (AFDM) and
   were significantly higher at the downstream site for all three years. 
   Differences were attributed to faster growth rates combined with
   relatively small differences in cohort production intervals.
   Average densities ranged from 117 to 602 individuals/m2, and significant
   differences were observed between sites and years, with annual
   differences being most pronounced.  Average densities were related more
   to initial densities than to mortality rates and thus factors governing
   number of eggs laid and hatching success were responsible for annual
   differences in densities.  The data suggest that hatching success may
   have been influenced by the thermal regime of the previous winter.
   Annual production ranged from 398 to 2857 mg/m2/yr and differences were
   significant between sites and years.  Much of the between-site variation
   in production estimates was explained by differences in maximum nymphal
   weight, while differences in mean densities explained much of the annual
   variation in production.}},

   environmental variables and of population demographics were used to
   assess the relationships between environmental variables and population
   features.  Abundance, production, and biomass were higher in habitats
   with warmer ice-free temperatures, but the length at which adults first
   developed shelled larvae, and maximum adult length and weight, were less
   in such habitats.  Productivity, biomass, and the proportion of adults
   brooding shelled larvae were higher in habitats that had higher calcium
   hardness, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, and sulphate levels.  These
   factors should be considered in studies that attempt to relate variation
